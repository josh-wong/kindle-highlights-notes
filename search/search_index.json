In particular, it\u2019s handy if the person reading the test code can quickly figure out: The class being tested (if any) The function being tested The situation or bug being tested A simple approach to construct a good test function name is to just concatenate that information together, possibly with a \u201cTest_\u201d prefix. For instance, instead of naming it Test1(), we can use the Test_() format: void Test_SortAndFilterDocs()\u00a0{ \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0... } Depending on how sophisticated this test is, you might consider a separate test function for each situation being tested. You could use the Test__() format: void Test_SortAndFilterDocs_BasicSorting()\u00a0{ \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0... } void Test_SortAndFilterDocs_NegativeValues()\u00a0{ \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0... } ... Don\u2019t be afraid of having a long or clunky name here. This isn\u2019t a function that will be called throughout your codebase, so the reasons for avoiding long function names don\u2019t apply. The test function name is effectively acting like a comment. Also, if that test fails, most testing frameworks will print out the name of the function where the assertion failed, so a descriptive name is especially helpful. ^ref-11345</p> <ul> <li>Location: 3060</li> </ul>"},{"location":"01_%E2%AD%90The%20Art%20of%20Readable%20Code/#highlight_30","title":"Highlight","text":"<p>In test code, readability is still very important.

Every aspect of the mushroom\u2019s existence was fraught with sexual allusions, and in its phallic form the ancients saw a replica of the fertility god himself. It was the \u201cson of God\u201d; its drug was a purer form of the god\u2019s own spermatozoa than that discoverable in any other form of living matter. It was, in fact, God himself, manifest on earth.

It was this same means of communication that brought him in touch with his god, to flatter, cajole, even threaten to obtain the means of life.

One of the problems facing the student of Old Testament Hebrew is the probability that the classical tongue of the Bible does not accurately represent the spoken language of the ancient Israelites. Certainly the vocabulary of the Bible is far too limited in extent to tell us much about the workaday world of ancient Canaan. When it comes to analyzing the linguistic and phonetic structure of biblical Hebrew in terms of actual speech, the conviction grows that what we have is not the spoken dialect of any one community living in a single place at one time, but a kind of mixed, artificial language, composed perhaps of a number of dialects and used specifically for religious purposes. The importance of a liturgical language from our immediate point of view is that it will have been essentially conservative. It is in such writing that we can expect to find words used in their most primitive sense.</p> <ul> <li>Page: 5</li> </ul>"},{"location":"The%20Sacred%20Mushroom%20and%20the%20Cross/#note_7","title":"Note","text":"<p>Interesting theory about how the Bible contains a mix of languages, interpretations, and expressions throughout history.
