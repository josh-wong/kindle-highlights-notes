In 1830 a sixteen-year-old with big ideas and a knack for intricate mechanics named Samuel Colt had carved his first model of a revolving pistol out of wood. Six years later, he took out a patent on it. In 1838 a company in Paterson, New Jersey, began to manufacture Colt\u2019s patented firearms. Among them was a .36-caliber, five-chambered revolving pistol with an octagonal barrel and a concealed trigger that dropped down when the gun was cocked. It was not the first such idea, but it was believed to be the first that was put into production for general use. There was just one problem with the new gun. No one wanted it. The weapon\u2019s natural market, the U.S. government, could not see any application and refused to subsidize it. The weapon had the feel of a cavalry sidearm, but just then the U.S. Army did not have a cavalry. Nor did the new pistol seem to interest private citizens. It was a nifty, if somewhat impractical, product. Oddly, the only people who wanted it were in the exotic and faraway Republic of Texas. ^ref-11367 - Location: 2675</p>","title":"Highlight"},{"location":"Empire%20of%20the%20Summer%20Moon/#highlight_2","text":"<p>In 1844, fully six years after he had begun to produce his repeating pistols, his invention was a failure.

The next morning they attacked the Cheyenne village of Chief Black Kettle\u2014a village that had just made a truce with the white soldiers. But Chivington\u2019s purpose was only to kill Indians, and that is what he did. He began by pounding the lodges with the fragmenting shells from four mountain howitzers. And then his men streamed in, many drunk or hungover from the night\u2019s drinking, slashing and shooting indiscriminately. At the time of the attack, there were some six hundred Cheyennes in the camp. Of these, no more than thirty-five were warriors. Most of the men were out hunting buffalo. There is little point in describing in detail what happened. Children were shot, point-blank. Babies were bayoneted. Saddest of all was the sight of the Indians huddling around a large American flag that had been draped over Black Kettle\u2019s tipi. They gathered and flew white flags and the women opened their shirts so there could be no mistaking their sex, and waited patiently for the soldiers to see that the Indians were friendly and stop the killing. Instead, they were cut down. When the smoke had cleared and the screaming had stopped, three hundred Cheyennes lay dead. All were scalped, and many were mutilated. One man had cut out a woman\u2019s private parts and exhibited them on a stick.29 The massacre quickly became public, mainly because a number of Chivington\u2019s soldiers were disgusted by what had happened and later told their story to the press, but also because the victors had not been shy of bragging about what they had done, of which they were proud, initially at least. Chivington\u2019s return to Denver, in fact, was triumphant, the newspapers full of stories praising him. Chivington himself proclaimed that \u201cPosterity will speak of me as the great Indian fighter. I have eclipsed Kit Carson.\u201d (Carson responded: \u201cJis to think of that dog Chivington and his dirty hounds up thar at Sand Creek. His men shot down squaws and blew the brains out of innocent children. You call sich soldiers Christians, do ye?\u201d)30At a theater in town the Colorado troopers had displayed their trophies for cheering crowds: tobacco pouches made from scrotums, fingers, scalps, purses made from pudenda cut from Cheyenne women.31 As the details became known, a wave of revulsion swept through the corridors of power and influence in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. The Sand Creek Massacre would have an enormous and lasting effect on the Indian policy that was made in those places. It is interesting to note, though, that such gut-churning shame and disgust was largely confined to the east. The protest over the killing of women was not echoed by any such sentiments in Indian country, where everyone knew that women were often combatants (they were not, in this case).

They have tourniquets tied around their arms and legs to stop the bleeding before they suffer the inevitable wounds that will cause it. They are high on opium to kill the pain from the injuries they know they will receive. They are armed with a rifle and typically one 30-round magazine, in addition to grenades or satchel charges of explosives. Their mission is to breach their enemy's position and kill as many as possible, then make it back to their side to hand off their rifle and die. Apparently, they get some heavenly reward for that action. Jungle warfare at night is not precise. It is hectic, confusing and scary. It is challenging to take out a sapper before he completes his mission. It is necessary to do neurological damage to disable him physically, because he will not bleed to death and is not immobilized by pain. You have to shoot the sapper enough times to get a hit in his brain or spinal cord.

The ratio must consider all of the people who make work for technical writers, including developers, designers, product managers, testers, and customer support engineers. The answer depends on what the developers are doing. You can assign a team of eight developers to spend six months working on performance, and their dedicated effort will result in just a few days of documentation work.

This hormone is essential for life and does you much good\u2014in moderate doses. But a continual flood of it weakens your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection. It slows down your bone cell growth, which over time can lead to osteoporosis. It drains potassium from your cells and makes it more difficult for your intestines to absorb calcium. It interrupts normal reproductive functions such as menstruation and the production of estrogen and testosterone. It causes you to retain water and store excess fat. It also hurts your brain. After about thirty minutes of stress and prolonged exposure to cortisol, the energy supply to the memory center of the brain, the hippocampus, drops by about 25 percent. Eventually, the neurons in the hippocampus begin to die. The result is that under high or prolonged stress, memory and concentration are impaired.
