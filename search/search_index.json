In particular, it\u2019s handy if the person reading the test code can quickly figure out: The class being tested (if any) The function being tested The situation or bug being tested A simple approach to construct a good test function name is to just concatenate that information together, possibly with a \u201cTest_\u201d prefix. For instance, instead of naming it Test1(), we can use the Test_() format: void Test_SortAndFilterDocs()\u00a0{ \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0... } Depending on how sophisticated this test is, you might consider a separate test function for each situation being tested. You could use the Test__() format: void Test_SortAndFilterDocs_BasicSorting()\u00a0{ \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0... } void Test_SortAndFilterDocs_NegativeValues()\u00a0{ \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0... } ... Don\u2019t be afraid of having a long or clunky name here. This isn\u2019t a function that will be called throughout your codebase, so the reasons for avoiding long function names don\u2019t apply. The test function name is effectively acting like a comment. Also, if that test fails, most testing frameworks will print out the name of the function where the assertion failed, so a descriptive name is especially helpful. ^ref-11345</p> <ul> <li>Location: 3060</li> </ul>"},{"location":"01_%E2%AD%90The%20Art%20of%20Readable%20Code/#highlight_30","title":"Highlight","text":"<p>In test code, readability is still very important.
