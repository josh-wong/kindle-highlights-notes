## Highlight

Staying aware of where you are, what is going on around you, and keeping your focus on the person talking to you will help distract your mind from its anxious thoughts. ^ref-57626

Social anxiety is often triggered by an initial thought, which then attaches to a memory and subsequent emotion. ^ref-44757

## Highlight

Don’t call attention to your shyness, either. First, it sets you up with any new people around you to try and take advantage of you being shy. Broadcasting that you are shy is equivalent to wearing “I’m insecure” on a sandwich board in the middle of Times Square. ^ref-17376
