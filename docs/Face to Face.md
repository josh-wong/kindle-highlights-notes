## Highlight

Meeting another person’s gaze can feel awkward, frightening, even embarrassing at times. Being “real” with another person isn’t always comfortable either—many times it’s not. But I have learned that if we want to form connections in our lives that actually mean something, we have to make ourselves vulnerable. ^ref-62462

## Highlight

Research suggests that the ideal length of time to hold a person’s gaze if you want to form an authentic connection is seven to ten seconds (three to five if you are in a group).10 Any longer than that can turn people off and start to feel creepy. ^ref-12459

## Highlight

virtual interactions can only get you so far. Swiping left or right is transactional. You can’t find trust, authenticity, or intimacy using Google. And exchanging texts and emails doesn’t give you a chance to really connect spirit to spirit with someone. If what you want is a meaningful relationship that goes beyond the surface, at some point you have to get to know a person face to face. Only then can you read their eyes, body language, and vibe to get clues about their character, what they’re really thinking, and whether there is something special between you. ^ref-16516

## Highlight

Looking into someone’s eyes, I can get a better feel for their emotional state. I can tell when their eyes light up that they are excited about what I am asking or interested in what I am saying. I can tell when they start to shift their eyes away from mine that they are uncomfortable with where things are going or are losing interest. All of these cues help me navigate the conversation and connect. ^ref-33568
