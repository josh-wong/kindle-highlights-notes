## Highlight
**27:19:** We live in an interesting time in that, materially, things are arguably better than they have ever been before. Yet, we all seem to be losing our minds, thinking the world is one giant toilet bowl about to be flushed. 

An irrational sense of hopelessness is spreading across the rich, developed world. It's a paradox of progress. The better things get, the more anxious and desperate we all seem to feel. 

In recent years, writers such as Stephen Pinker and Hans Rosling have been making the case that we're wrong to feel so pessimistic‚Äîthat things are, in fact, the best they've ever been and likely going to get even better. Both men have filled long, heavy books with many charts and graphs that start at one corner and always somehow end up in the opposite quarter. Both men have explained at length the biases and incorrect assumptions we all carry that cause us to feel that things are so much worse than they are. 

Progress, they argue, has continued uninterrupted throughout modern history. People are more educated and literate than ever before. Violence has trended down for decades, possibly centuries. Racism, sexism, discrimination, and violence against women are at their lowest points in recorded history. We have more rights than ever before. Half the planet has access to the Internet. Extreme poverty is at an all-time low worldwide. Wars are smaller and less frequent than at any other time in recorded history. Children are dying less, and people are living longer. There's more wealth than ever before. We've, like, cured a bunch of diseases and stuff. 

And they're right. It's important to know these facts. But reading these books is also kind of like listening to your Uncle Larry prat along about how much worse things were when he was your age. Even though he's right, it doesn't necessarily make you feel any better about your problems. Because, for all the good news being published today, here's some other surprising statistics:

- In the United States, symptoms of depression and anxiety are on an 80-year upswing among young people and a 20-year upswing among the adult population. Not only are people experiencing depression and greater numbers, but they're experiencing it at earlier ages with each generation. 
- Since 1985, men and women have reported lower levels of life satisfaction. Part of that is probably because stress levels have risen over the past 30 years. 
- Drug overdoses have recently hit an all-time high as the opioid crisis has wrecked much of the United States and Canada. 
- Across the US population, feelings of loneliness and social isolation are up. Nearly half of all Americans now report feeling isolated, left out, or alone in their lives. 
- Social trust is also not only down across the developed world, but plummeting, meaning fewer people than ever trust their government, the media, or one another.

**32:34:** To build and maintain hope, we need three things: a sense of control, a belief in the value of something, and a community.

"Control" means we feel as though we‚Äôre in control of our own life, that we can affect our fate.

‚ÄúValues‚Äù means we find something important enough to work toward‚Äîsomething better that‚Äôs worth striving for.

‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù means we are part of a group that values the same things we do and is working toward achieving those things. 

Without a community, we feel isolated, and our values cease to mean anything. Without values, nothing appears worth pursuing. And without control, we feel powerless to pursue anything. Lose any of the three, and you lose the other two. Lose any of the three, and you lose hope.
