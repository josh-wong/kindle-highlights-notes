## Highlight

Once we decouple ourself from the frustrations, regrets, and painful memories that burden us, we experience emotional freedom. It manifests in our behaviors, decisions, and level of self-awareness. It shows in our relationships with loved ones, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. It reveals itself in the quality of our work and the satisfaction we feel from having completed the work. ^ref-5526

## Highlight

Once we let go of our bleak, defeatist headspace, it can no longer hold us back. Letting it go releases us to focus on the important things that truly matter to us. ^ref-51514

## Highlight

Clinging to painful memories puts significant strain on our confidence, self-esteem, and mental resilience. It slowly wears us down and can even set the stage for depression. ^ref-3728

## Highlight

Remaining emotionally attached to past regrets, judgments, and even personal grudges puts significant strain on our bodies, as well. It raises our stress levels, increases our blood pressure, and can even impair our ability to sleep soundly. ^ref-19929

## Highlight

When we let go of the past, we give ourself permission to no longer focus on pleasing others. Instead, we can focus on making decisions that prioritize our own needs and make the best use of the resources at our disposal. ^ref-49125

---
## Highlight

When we fixate on others’ perceptions of us, we implicitly allow them to make our decisions for us. Our life is no longer our own. And our emotional health becomes dependent on what others think of us. ^ref-31827

## Highlight

Whatever its origin, perfectionism always leads to our dissatisfaction. If we believe that being perfect is the only way we’ll be happy, we guarantee our perpetual unhappiness. When we stop trying to be perfect, we experience less anxiety, enjoy more creativity, and become more inclined to take purposeful, calculated risks. And importantly, we free ourself from the emotional burden of constantly striving for others’ approval. ^ref-38482

## Highlight

When we let go of our fear of failure, we become more willing to step outside our comfort zone. Our confidence and self-esteem improve as we take leaps of faith based on the belief that failing doesn’t mean disaster. Conversely, our failures often pave the road toward personal growth and self-improvement. ^ref-50730

## Highlight

Problems arise when we allow ourself to become agitated by others’ opinions. It’s not enough that we feel we’re right; we must convince other people that we’re right. And so we spend time each day arguing about everything from politics and cultural norms to the economy and whether scrambled eggs should be eaten alone or with ketchup. Needless to say, this constant bickering can be emotionally exhausting. Moreover, it’s rarely rewarding. ^ref-63051

### Note
This line of thinking is exactly why social media can be so detrimental and a waste of time.

## Highlight

The main stumbling block associated with the fear of missing out is found in its name: fear. We fear moving on. We fear missing a chance to experience something good. We fear losing out on something that might happen. Unfortunately, this anxiety causes us to perpetuate our suffering by staying emotionally attached to things that make us unhappy. ^ref-11353

## Highlight

But pride flirts with the dark side of our ego. Left unchecked, it can cause us to feel arrogant and self-important. When it does so, it becomes a destructive force. It turns into a stumbling block that negatively impacts our relationships, careers, and decisions. Unchallenged, pride also discourages us from letting go the things that haunt us. We become less inclined to admit our mistakes, convinced we’re faultless. We become less willing to apologize, certain that others are to blame and thus owe us an apology. We habitually compare ourself to others to measure our self-worth, and obsess over keeping up with them. ^ref-32858

## Highlight

Constantly trying to make everyone else happy only leads to misery. We lose ourself in their priorities. We spend so much energy catering to others’ needs and wants that we have none left to address our own. ^ref-4173

## Highlight

One of the reasons is that our obsession with being happy causes us to overemphasize the impact of our failures. When we fail, we sometimes experience intensely negative emotions that are unwarranted by the circumstances. A study was published awhile back in the journal Emotion that described this tendency.1 The researchers found that people who obsess over being happy often experience more stress as their obsession causes them to dwell on negative thoughts and emotions attached to their failures. ^ref-8148

## Highlight

The problem is, when we focus on things that can go wrong rather than celebrate the good things in our life, we operate from a place of fear. This fear reinforces the emotionally painful experiences we’ve endured in the past. It highlights our unmet needs. It emphasizes past betrayals. It underscores our dashed expectations, painful memories, and personal grudges. It’s a constant reminder that so many things have hurt us in the past and can potentially hurt us again in the future. So we cling to the painful memories and the cynicism, distrust, and negativity attached to them. It’s a survival mechanism. ^ref-11478

Lastly, review the list of things this individual did that displeased you. Keeping in mind his or her positive traits, ask yourself “how serious is this issue to me in the long run?” ^ref-12607

We only have 24 hours each day. It’s helpful to recognize how some of this time is already committed. ^ref-4880

## Highlight

This exercise serves two purposes. First, it reveals how much of our time is already committed, even if we don’t realize it. Second, it underscores the fact that overcommitting means siphoning away time from important areas of our life. ^ref-4358

## Highlight

Emotional diversity helps us to let go of our distressing memories, painful regrets, and upsetting grievances. We experience an array of emotions that makes us more adaptable to our circumstances. We become more resilient to the negative thoughts and feelings that might otherwise monopolize our headspace. Rather than obsessing over our emotional pain, we become more comfortable confronting its source, managing our feelings regarding it, and finally letting those feelings go. ^ref-49010

## Highlight

One final note… I encourage you to revisit The Art of Letting GO whenever you’re feeling angry, depressed, or downtrodden by life. You don’t necessarily have to read the entire book again. Rather, simply look through the table of contents and revisit the section that resonates with you in that moment. ^ref-32895
