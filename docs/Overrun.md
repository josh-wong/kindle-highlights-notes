## Highlight

The reason for the seemingly super strength and ability to shrug off bullet impacts would become apparent later when we examined the bodies of the dead North Vietnamese soldiers. They were “sappers.” Our senior NCOs explained that sappers are basically suicide troops. They have tourniquets tied around their arms and legs to stop the bleeding before they suffer the inevitable wounds that will cause it. They are high on opium to kill the pain from the injuries they know they will receive. They are armed with a rifle and typically one 30-round magazine, in addition to grenades or satchel charges of explosives. Their mission is to breach their enemy's position and kill as many as possible, then make it back to their side to hand off their rifle and die. Apparently, they get some heavenly reward for that action. Jungle warfare at night is not precise. It is hectic, confusing and scary. It is challenging to take out a sapper before he completes his mission. It is necessary to do neurological damage to disable him physically, because he will not bleed to death and is not immobilized by pain. You have to shoot the sapper enough times to get a hit in his brain or spinal cord. If you break the spinal cord, everything below that break stops working….. immediately. ^ref-61645
