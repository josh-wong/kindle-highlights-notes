When I stretch out upon the earth and let my entire body relax upon her, I do feel better. Sometimes, I even go to a favorite tree and lean against her, taking the time to stay there until I feel better. ^ref-55726

Goodness is everyday. It is noticing—noticing a new dress, noticing pain, noticing when someone is not being honest. ^ref-58785

## Highlight

Goodness is never out of style. And, we often have to slow down to see and experience it in ourselves and in others. ^ref-43539

## Highlight

When we lose our sense of humor, we lose our perspective on life. Without humor, we can easily confuse reality and begin to think that we are the center of the universe and that what happens to us will, indeed, change the course of human events. ^ref-8187
- Location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=557)

## Highlight

My worry will not change the course of events. I am the only person I can change. ^ref-22815

## Highlight

Happiness is right now. How often we rob ourselves of the happiness we are experiencing in the moment because we are afraid that it will go away. ^ref-18970

---
## Highlight

So many people destroy relationships by refusing to enjoy the happiness that is present today and worrying about what tomorrow will bring. ^ref-22148

Nothing is interesting if you’re not interested. ^ref-4359

I am, of course, a product of my culture. It’s comforting to know that we both can change. ^ref-27050

---
## Highlight

What if instead of “medicating” our fears and powerlessness we let ourselves feel these feelings without trying to medicate them with anything. ^ref-53303
- Location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=797)

---
## Highlight

Fear is a part of living. We all are afraid sometimes. There’s nothing wrong with being afraid. Usually, our fear of fear is the problem, and not the fear itself. Likewise, we often feel powerless because we are! Actually, we are powerless over much of life. The sooner we realize this powerlessness, the better off we will be. That’s where spirituality begins. ^ref-61003
- Location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=798)

---
## Highlight

How much of our “worry time” could be spent doing something that we want to do or something the person we are worrying about would want us to do? Some of us are good at doing “double time” and can work our worry in while we are doing other things. And, I am not sure that is efficient. We may just be giving part of ourselves to each task. ^ref-33296

## Highlight

My sadness often exists only to remind me of the joy in my life. ^ref-32307
- Location: [920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=920)

---
## Highlight

How much time we waste in what might have been when we have only to deal with what is! Often the anticipation is much worse than dealing with the actual event, no matter how horrible it is. Pain is that way. I think we cause pain by anticipating it. Better to deal with it as we must. ^ref-17679
- Location: [1003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1003)

---
## Highlight

How difficult it is to just let a relationship be, not manage or direct it, and just participate in it. ^ref-56106
- Location: [1026](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1026)

---
## Highlight

It’s important not to blurt out everything that comes to our minds, especially if we aren’t clear. And, it’s important to take responsibility for what we say. ^ref-34156
- Location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1052)

---
## Highlight

What a loss it is that we have come to think that when no one else is around we are with no one. When we are alone we are, indeed, with one of the most important people in our lives. If we use our alone-time to worry, we transform alone-time into isolation, and isolation will destroy us. ^ref-61854
- Location: [1126](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1126)

---
## Highlight

As worriers, we want to know exactly what’s possible and what’s impossible and then go from there. We would much rather know something is impossible before we attempt it than attempt it and thus prove it is impossible. ^ref-48433
- Location: [1157](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1157)

---
## Highlight

One of the ways we worriers have learned to cope is by not telling others about our worrying for fear they will start worrying. Somehow, we believe we are such good cons that if we don’t tell others about our worrying they will not know that we are worrying. ^ref-61907
- Location: [1189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1189)

---
## Highlight

Often, sharing our concerns gives us an opportunity to let them go. We do need to look carefully, however, at whether we are really ready to give them up. ^ref-41719
- Location: [1193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1193)

---
## Highlight

Remember, those who genuinely care about us truly want to know what’s going on with us. ^ref-45020
- Location: [1195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1195)

---
## Highlight

Often, our minds are our worst enemies. Or, we let them be. With little effort at all we can think ourselves into a complete tizzy. We cannot actually live in the future … but … our minds can and do. ^ref-20435
- Location: [1212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1212)

## Highlight

“What others think about me and say about me(!) is none of my business,” ^ref-44235
- Location: [1236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1236)

---
## Highlight

Worrying pulls us into ourselves and away from the other person and we can hide behind walls of concern. Unfortunately, walls of concern are still walls, and walls always separate us from those we love the most. ^ref-61705
- Location: [1307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1307)

---
## Highlight

Good things happen every day. We have only to notice. ^ref-14929
- Location: [1444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1444)

---
## Highlight

The problem with worrying is, the more we do it, the more we isolate ourselves. The problem with isolating ourselves is, the more we do it, the more we do it. ^ref-55540
- Location: [1662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1662)

---
## Highlight

Control is almost a knee-jerk reaction to worry. We also become very self-centered. As we move more and more into our world of worry, our world gets smaller and smaller and we tend to believe it revolves around us. ^ref-63287
- Location: [1839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1839)

---
## Highlight

These brains, miraculous though they are, always need a certain chemical produced in the body to keep them in balance. It seems that certain chemicals can only be produced through laughter, and laughter at oneself seems to produce the most potent dosage. ^ref-58190
- Location: [1852](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1852)

---
## Highlight

We also get in trouble when we believe that relationships are built upon focusing on the other person. Because when we focus upon the other person we also tend to focus upon what is wrong with them and what we need to do to fix them or to get them to fix themselves. ^ref-42552
- Location: [1964](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=1964)

---
## Highlight

We tend to send our energy where our attention is. Unfortunately, not all energy is positive. And when we send our energy in a negative way, we may well send those we love negative energy without even realizing it. ^ref-53928
- Location: [2087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2087)

---
## Highlight

When it gets right down to it, it is really none of our business what others think about us or what they say about us. We have no control over either. It is, however, up to us whether we send out engraved invitations to move into our minds. ^ref-51025
- Location: [2314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2314)

---
## Highlight

Our tendency to blame others can be a red flag that there is something going on that we need to look at. For many of us, our knee-jerk reaction is to look for someone to blame. We may even focus upon ourselves as a good “blame object” and in that process, objectify ourselves just as we objectify others. ^ref-3667
- Location: [2464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2464)

---
## Highlight

The issue is to stop and see what we are feeling and see what we need. ^ref-5571
- Location: [2467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2467)

---
## Highlight

In our illusionary approach to our lives we have been able to fool ourselves into thinking that things should go right and … we have a very specific idea of what “right” is. ^ref-28101
- Location: [2498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2498)

---
## Highlight

For meditation to be an everyday thing, we need to discover the ways we already have meditation in our lives. ^ref-29681
- Location: [2511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2511)

---
## Highlight

We put foods, medicines, tobacco smoke, and drugs and alcohol into our bodies without stopping to think what we are doing to them … and, still they carry on. ^ref-26651
- Location: [2664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2664)

---
## Highlight

How often do we let up from battering our bodies to just say “thanks”? ^ref-51450
- Location: [2667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2667)

---
## Highlight

Our bodies get tired for a reason. Our bodies get sick for a reason. Ignoring what our bodies are telling us is a form of abuse and neglect. ^ref-34093
- Location: [2865](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=2865)

---
## Highlight

We want our relationships to last and we just can’t stand the tension of seeing whether they will last or not. We would rather know what we are dealing with and then we will deal with it. ^ref-25314
- Location: [3004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=3004)

---
## Highlight

We get to a point where we would rather destroy the possibility than wait for the slow, gradual evolution of a relationship. ^ref-46618
- Location: [3006](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=3006)

---
## Highlight

Yet, teasing can be very loving. In fact, many people only tease those they love and teasing is a loving form of intimacy. Teasing can be a way of saying, “I see this in you and I love you for it.” ^ref-30241
- Location: [3090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=3090)

---
## Highlight

Let’s take hope, for example. When our minds narrow down the things we hope for to one or even two possibilities, we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. We are narrowing the possibility of what we want, and we are increasing the odds against something good happening a thousandfold. ^ref-7240
- Location: [3222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00F8FA2B4&location=3222)

---
## Highlight

We need to learn the difference between isolation and alone-time. ^ref-6392
