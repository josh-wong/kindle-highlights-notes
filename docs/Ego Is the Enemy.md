## Highlight

The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition. ^ref-36733

## Highlight

A true student is like a sponge. Absorbing what goes on around him, filtering it, latching on to what he can hold. A student is self-critical and self-motivated, always trying to improve his understanding so that he can move on to the next topic, the next challenge. A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. There is no room for ego there. ^ref-33247

## Highlight

Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous. ^ref-30269

## Highlight

What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective. ^ref-36580

## Highlight

Passion is form over function. Purpose is function, function, function. ^ref-4281

## Highlight

Those who have subdued their ego understand that it doesn’t degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them. ^ref-16632

## Highlight

Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride. ^ref-1712

One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important. —BERTRAND RUSSELL ^ref-24532

---
## Highlight

A sense of belonging to something larger, of realizing that “human things are an infinitesimal point in the immensity.” It is in these moments that we’re not only free but drawn toward important questions: Who am I? What am I doing? What is my role in this world? ^ref-19760

## Highlight

There’s an old line about how if you want to live happy, live hidden. ^ref-42352

## Highlight

Make use of what’s around you. Don’t let stubbornness make a bad situation worse. ^ref-15160

---
## Highlight

Sometimes because we can’t face what’s been said or what’s been done, we do the unthinkable in response to the unbearable: we escalate. This is ego in its purest and most toxic form. ^ref-8170

---
## Highlight

Ego says we’re the immovable object, the unstoppable force. This delusion causes the problems. It meets failure and adversity with rule breaking—betting everything on some crazy scheme; doubling down on behind-the-scenes machinations or unlikely Hail Marys—even though that’s what got you to this pain point in the first place. ^ref-18610

## Highlight

Yet we find that what defines great leaders like Douglass is that instead of hating their enemies, they feel a sort of pity and empathy for them. ^ref-24283

---
## Highlight

It is no easy task to go head-to-head with one’s ego. To accept first that ego may be there. Then to subject it to scrutiny and criticism. Most of us can’t handle uncomfortable self-examination. It’s easier to do just about anything else—in fact, some of the world’s most unbelievable accomplishments are undoubtedly a result of a desire to avoid facing the darkness of ego. ^ref-46281

## Highlight

My friend the philosopher and martial artist Daniele Bolelli once gave me a helpful metaphor. He explained that training was like sweeping the floor. Just because we’ve done it once, doesn’t mean the floor is clean forever. Every day the dust comes back. Every day we must sweep. ^ref-23108
