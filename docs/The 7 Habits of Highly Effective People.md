## Highlight

The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view. ^ref-6643

## Highlight

It becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum change, we need to work on our basic paradigms. ^ref-64041

Albert Einstein observed, “The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.” ^ref-61843

## Highlight

Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three. ^ref-56398

## Highlight

But much of our current emphasis on independence is a reaction to dependence—to having others control us, define us, use us, and manipulate us. ^ref-36142

## Highlight

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. If we don’t continually invest in improving our own PC, we severely limit our options. We’re locked into our present situation, running scared of our corporation or our boss’s opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive. Again, it simply isn’t effective. ^ref-61436

## Highlight

When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden eggs, the benefits, than they are in preserving the relationship that makes them possible, they often become insensitive and inconsiderate, neglecting the little kindnesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship. They begin to use control levers to manipulate each other, to focus on their own needs, to justify their own position and look for evidence to show the wrongness of the other person. The love, the richness, the softness and spontaneity begin to deteriorate. The goose gets sicker day by day. ^ref-24425

## Highlight

There are organizations that talk a lot about the customer and then completely neglect the people that deal with the customer—the employees. The PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers. ^ref-59864
- Location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=819)

### Note
Agree. Treating your employees like you do your customers has a ripple effect not only throughout the organization but also externally--for example, when attracting talent or new customers.

## Highlight

We are not our feelings. We are not our moods. We are not even our thoughts. ^ref-6473

---
## Highlight

Self-awareness enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we “see” ourselves—our self-paradigm, the most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviors, but also how we see other people. It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. ^ref-44769

---
## Highlight

If the only vision we have of ourselves comes from the social mirror—from the current social paradigm and from the opinions, perceptions, and paradigms of the people around us—our view of ourselves is like the reflection in the crazy mirror room at the carnival. ^ref-43947

---
## Highlight

Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling. ^ref-54160

---
## Highlight

Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and their performance. ^ref-53706
- Location: [990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=990)

---
## Highlight

Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the “social weather.” When people treat them well, they feel well; when people don’t, they become defensive or protective. Reactive people build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of other people to control them. ^ref-26995
- Location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=993)

---
## Highlight

Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. ^ref-47250

## Highlight

It’s not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. ^ref-6067

## Highlight

what matters most is how we respond to what we experience in life. ^ref-8016
- Location: [1048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1048)

---
## Highlight

Our basic nature is to act, and not be acted upon. As well as enabling us to choose our response to particular circumstances, this empowers us to create circumstances. Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, obnoxious, or aggressive. It does mean recognizing our responsibility to make things happen. ^ref-16395
- Location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1052)

---
## Highlight

A serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People become reinforced in the paradigm that they are determined, and they produce evidence to support the belief. They feel increasingly victimized and out of control, not in charge of their life or their destiny. They blame outside forces—other people, circumstances, even the stars—for their own situation. ^ref-50219

## Highlight

Management is a bottom line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals with the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish? In the words of both Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis, “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.” Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall. ^ref-8165
- Location: [1443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1443)

---
## Highlight

Efficient management without effective leadership is, as one individual has phrased it, “like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic.” No management success can compensate for failure in leadership. But leadership is hard because we’re often caught in a management paradigm. ^ref-21830

---
## Highlight

If our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from our marriage, then we become highly dependent upon that relationship. We become vulnerable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and treatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the relationship—a new child, in-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth. ^ref-62368
- Location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1636)

---
## Highlight

As proactive people, we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives. We can write a personal mission statement, a personal constitution. A mission statement is not something you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites to produce it in final form. It may take you several weeks or even months before you feel really comfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete and concise expression of your innermost values and directions. Even then, you will want to review it regularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. ^ref-48937
- Location: [1879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1879)

---
## Highlight

Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes you because it forces you to think through your priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior with your beliefs. As you do, other people begin to sense that you’re not being driven by everything that happens to you. You have a sense of mission about what you’re trying to do and you are excited about it. ^ref-40693
