## Highlight

If you’re charged with following a style guide that you haven’t yet mastered, then restraint—doing no harm—is your best tactic. ^ref-44540

## Highlight

1. Don’t bother writers with questions they can’t answer. ^ref-15483

## Highlight

2. Be brief. Don’t patronize or overexplain. ^ref-57206

## Highlight

3. Read over the early queries when you’re finished. ^ref-60034

---
## Highlight

• In editing, every time you make a mark on someone else’s copy, you must know why, according to an authority, chapter and verse, you are making that change. ^ref-32494
- Location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=565)

---
## Highlight

• In querying, every time you challenge a writer’s grammar, usage, or facts, you must first either look it up, remember looking it up, or (if it’s one of those evolving issues) remember looking it up in the not-too-distant past. ^ref-29582

---
## Highlight

What these questions suggest is that copy editors fail to understand that style rules (which pertain to punctuation, capitalization, hyphenation, preferred spellings, and conventions for citing sources, among other things) are often by nature arbitrary and changeable. ^ref-25059

---
## Highlight

The inability to identify the difference between negotiable matters of style and less negotiable matters of English grammar is perhaps the most common cause of grief ^ref-753

---
## Highlight

Remember: when requests from an intimidating author will affect a project’s cost or schedule, you don’t always have to say no; you just have to be careful about saying yes. ^ref-64940
- Location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=690)

---
## Highlight

Since we’ve already agreed that there’s no room for power-tripping as a copy editor, it stands to reason that there are going to be times when it’s expedient to back down. ^ref-22886
- Location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=763)

---
## Highlight

You may have noticed this phenomenon: often it seems that the more tinkering you do in a document, the more errors remain. ^ref-31447
- Location: [832](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=832)

---
## Highlight

The first question is always “What’s the rule?” instead of “What is helpful?” or “What makes sense?” or—the unthinkable—“Can I break this rule?” ^ref-17172
- Location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=884)

---
## Highlight

We have the power to break the rule. ^ref-31209
- Location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=885)

---
## Highlight

Understanding the thinking behind a style choice gives you the power both to discard it when better thinking should prevail and to argue for it more convincingly when the reasoning applies. ^ref-22959
- Location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=888)

---
## Highlight

Copy editors have a choice as to what kind of power they wield. They can wave the rule book about and try to assume the power of saying “No, you can’t” to writers, or they can acquire the power of knowing when to break a rule in order to help writers achieve great writing. ^ref-60129
- Location: [890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=890)

---
## Highlight

My point is that a work will never be edited the same way twice, and it will never be considered perfect, no matter how many times it’s edited—probably not even by the last person who edited it. ^ref-24772
- Location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01DGPSNWW&location=992)

---
## Highlight

So when you submit work—even if it consists of previously published material—be prepared for someone to find something that needs changing. When we talk about not taking editing “personally,” realize that this is why. A good amount of copyediting has nothing to do with how great a writer you are. ^ref-59582

---
## Highlight

If it doesn’t seem to follow any guide you’re familiar with, but it’s more or less consistent and makes sense, seriously consider leaving it alone. ^ref-44608
