## Highlight

The Power Shower Turn the shower to hot and wash. Do Wim Hof breathing (thirty to fifty breaths, or until you feel tingling and/or mild light-headedness). Turn the shower as cold as it can get. Continue Wim Hof breaths until breathing calms. Hold at the bottom of breath until the gasp reflex kicks in. Optional: Repeat breathing cycle up to twice more, at your discretion, with cold water running continuously or with periods of warm water between cycles to create contrast. Total cold water exposure = ~3 minutes ^ref-5263

## Highlight

When you’re cooking for your health, even if you’re indulging in some delicious pan-fried foods, you want to make sure you don’t heat your fats—olive oil, butter, coconut oil—to what is called their “smoke point.” This is where healthy fats start to turn unhealthy, because once they burn, they start to produce toxic compounds called aldehydes, which, interestingly, are also in the class of compounds that accumulate when we drink too much alcohol, making us feel hungover. ^ref-8117

## Highlight

In an earlier era, we used to do things socially—people were in bowling leagues, played music with each other, sat on their porches and talked. Ironically, in a world of social media, we’ve gotten considerably less social. The result has been an epidemic of existential angst and loneliness. The easiest way to solve that in your life is to actively seek out in-person connection and community after work. ^ref-28875

## Highlight

Visualization is a prime example of that intentional placebo at work, one we’ve already seen in this book with those study participants who visualized themselves lifting heavy weights and getting stronger as a result. The same principle applies with owning the day. Visualizing yourself doing it will have a positive impact. ^ref-10297
