## Highlight

Just like for the trees, heavy rain and strong winds are to the advantage of good people, it’s how they may grow calm, disciplined, humble, and strong. ^ref-26153

## Highlight

Just like the tree must tighten its grip not to fall down with every breeze, we must strengthen our position if we don’t want to be swept off our feet by every trifle. ^ref-9735

## Highlight

For the Stoics and all other schools of ancient philosophy, the ultimate goal of life was eudaimonia, to become good (eu) with your inner daimon. ^ref-22988

---
## Highlight

This brings us to the second promise of Stoicism: Philosophy trains us to be able to take on every obstacle in life with the right mindset so that life keeps on going smoothly. ^ref-8656

- Location: [348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=348)

## Highlight

And the same is true for philosophers; just because life slaps, kicks, spits, and knocks us out doesn’t mean we should give up and leave, it means we should get back up and keep on getting better. ^ref-326

## Highlight

“Unharmed prosperity cannot endure a single blow,” says Seneca, but a man who has gone through countless misfortunes “acquires a skin calloused by suffering.” This man fights to the ground and carries on the fight even on his knees. He will never give up. ^ref-59713

- Location: [358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=358)

### Note
This reminds me of the message of psychiatrist Viktor Frankl in his book "Man's Search For Meaning."

## Highlight

Yet, we can only deal well with life’s challenges when we’re emotionally resilient and don’t let our emotions jerk us around. ^ref-57662

- Location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=378)

---
## Highlight

In other words, it’s more about unslaving ourselves from negative emotions, more like taming rather than getting rid of them. ^ref-42056

- Location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=399)

---
## Highlight

Stoic author Donald Robertson explains it well: “A brave man isn’t someone who doesn’t experience any trace of fear whatsoever but someone who acts courageously despite feeling anxiety.” ^ref-40349

- Location: [416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=416)

---
## Highlight

This comeback of Stoicism can be traced back to Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy and Albert Ellis’ rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which were influenced by Stoic philosophy. ^ref-7224

## Highlight

“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” – Marcus Aurelius ^ref-33248

---
## Highlight

Because somewhere in the darkness of the gap, they are lurking, the bad guys lead by regret, anxiety, and disillusionment. ^ref-2690

- Location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=629)

---
## Highlight

We cannot express our highest selves without at the same time contributing to the common good. If we seek the very best in ourselves, we will actively care for the wellbeing of all other human beings. The best for others will be the best for you. ^ref-51984

- Location: [784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=784)

---
## Highlight

We can choose our intentions and actions but the ultimate outcome depends on external variables beyond our control. ^ref-7534

- Location: [863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=863)

---
## Highlight

The good and bad things can only be found in your behavior. Expressing your highest self, as seen earlier, is sufficient for the happy and smoothly flowing life. Because it’s all that is within our power. Our actions matter greatly, and the development of one’s character is all that counts for the good life. ^ref-59971

---
## Highlight

Friendship is the most important preferred indifferent for the Stoics. Our human nature is not only rational but also social and, therefore, we’re naturally attracted to other people. And a good person always shows love, kindness, justice, and concern for his fellow human beings—for his brothers, neighbors, and strangers alike. Having wise and good friends is the most precious external thing in the world. ^ref-39010

- Location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=965)

---
## Highlight

Stoicism teaches that we’re very much responsible for our own happiness as well as unhappiness. It also teaches that taking this responsibility will improve our chances of attaining eudaimonia. The victim mentality—blaming external circumstances for our unhappiness—on the other hand, will make the happy life an impossible goal to reach. ^ref-3860

- Location: [1018](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=1018)

---
## Highlight

We must refuse to let the hands we’re dealt decide over our wellbeing. The Stoics say that outside events and other people may have the power to affect how and even whether you live, but they don’t have the power to ruin our lives. Only you yourself can ruin your life by getting jerked around by things you don’t control and by failing to act as well as you’re capable of. ^ref-11495

- Location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=1021)

---
## Highlight

We must keep in mind that happiness depends more on what we make of what happens rather than what happens in the first place. ^ref-59570

- Location: [1097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=1097)

## Highlight

They advised to occasionally practice getting uncomfortable in order to be better off in the future. The goal isn’t to punish yourself with a whip or something, the goal is to train endurance and self-control. ^ref-42216

---
## Highlight

Epictetus advises to rehearse the day in the morning, and then review your progress in the evening. At daybreak, we should ask ourselves a few questions: What do I still lack in order to achieve freedom from negative emotions? What do I need to achieve tranquility? What am I? A rational being. ^ref-23644

- Location: [1641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=1641)

---
## Highlight

Personally, I do the good, better, best exercise. I ask myself three simple questions: Good: What did I do well today? Better: How could I improve? What could I do better? Best: What do I need to do if I want to be the best version of myself? ^ref-20723

- Location: [1696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=1696)

---
## Highlight

This is a classic Stoic idea: Play your role well by being the best you can be, focusing on what you control, and ultimately being a good person. ^ref-37728

- Location: [1778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=1778)

## Highlight

Play your roles well, even if others don’t. ^ref-63595

- Location: [1782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=1782)

---
## Highlight

When you find yourself frustrated, don’t blame other people or outside events, but yourself and your unrealistic expectations. Turn your focus inward, remember, we must take responsibility. ^ref-53795

- Location: [2150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2150)

---
## Highlight

Don’t wish for life to be hard, but neither wish for it to be easier when it gets tough. Rather wish for the strength to deal with it. It’s an opportunity for growth. ^ref-45912

- Location: [2269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2269)

---
## Highlight

People do what seems right to them. If they do wrong, it’s because that’s what seems true to them. Therefore, we should not blame people, even if they treat us rudely and unfairly. They don’t do those things on purpose. As Socrates said: “Nobody does wrong willingly.” ^ref-50421

- Location: [2550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2550)

---
## Highlight

They don’t see what they’re doing. And because they’re ill, it’s not like they had a choice in that matter. So who are we to blame them? Let’s not resent what they do, because that’s like resenting their illness. The only appropriate response is compassion and forgiveness. ^ref-29841

- Location: [2609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2609)

---
## Highlight

You wouldn’t judge an injured teammate when he’s unable to catch a ball. In the exact same way the injured player shouldn’t judge the person who tells him off. Because the offender is injured too, just not in his body but in his mind. Even if we can’t see it from the outside. ^ref-5676

- Location: [2628](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2628)

---
## Highlight

It’s in your power to be kind to people. It’s in your power to stay true to your path and respond to evildoers with compassion, forgiveness, and kindness. ^ref-55834

- Location: [2639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2639)

## Highlight

“You are the average of the five people you spend most time with.” ^ref-53345

- Location: [2815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2815)

---
## Highlight

That’s why we should choose our friends carefully. They have the power to pull you either down or up to their level. You either get better, thanks to the people you spend time with, or you get worse because of them. ^ref-8765

- Location: [2816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2816)

---
## Highlight

The Stoics are clear on this: Don’t gossip. Don’t blame. Don’t complain. Don’t talk too much. Especially not about what’s not meaningful. ^ref-43560

- Location: [2910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MY2VFQD&location=2910)
