## Highlight

These topographic ghost stories of a planet recently locked in ice are told far beyond my own neighborhood: the Finger Lakes of New York were carved by massive glaciers, while the Great Lakes are basically the world’s largest puddles, left when the ice sheets melted only a few thousand years ago. The most dramatic example might be in the epic Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington, which were carved by truly mind-blowing cyclical floods called jökulhlaups. ^ref-1184

## Highlight

It may be less than a coincidence that at the same time animals like this were terrorizing the seas, our paddle-limbed fishy ancestors were making their first tentative forays onto dry land. As American Museum of Natural History paleontologist John Maisey told Nature, our ancestors “did not so much conquer the land, as escape from the water.” That is, they were literally scared onto terra firma. University of Chicago evolutionary biologist Neil Shubin writes, “The strategies to succeed in [the Devonian] were pretty obvious: get big, get armor, or get out of the water. It looks as if our distant ancestors avoided the fight.” ^ref-14453

## Highlight

As a result, temperature estimates for the End-Permian mass extinction and its aftermath strain belief. In the Karoo Desert, as rivers stopped winding, insects stopped buzzing, and mass death swept over the land, the temperature might have jumped as much as 16 degrees Celsius. On Pangaea, 140-degree-Fahrenheit heat waves wouldn’t have been unusual. In the tropics, ocean temperatures skyrocketed from 25 degrees Celsius—similar to today’s oceans—to perhaps upwards of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). This is the temperature of a hot tub, or as End-Permian expert Paul Wignall puts it, that of “very hot soup.” Multicellular life simply can’t exist in this sort of globe-spanning Jacuzzi. The complex proteins of life denature—that is, they cook. The language of academic papers is typically measured and sober, but even the peer-reviewed science literature describes the early Triassic period that followed this worst mass extinction ever as a “post-apocalyptic greenhouse.” ^ref-8604

And then, 20 million years after the Great Dying, something beautiful happened. It started raining. And it rained, and it rained. And it kept raining. Dinosaurs appeared. Not long after, the first flower blossomed.* Crocodile ancestors followed, along with the first true mammals. The planetary deluge was what’s known as the Carnian Pluvial Event, a little studied but extraordinary event in Earth’s history when the floodgates opened and the arid world got a sorely needed soak. It’s been called “the greening of Triassic Earth.” ^ref-14476

## Highlight

Undoubtedly, there are some obvious, unsettling parallels between the Triassic end-times and the current day—when, barring aggressive climate action, temperatures on the planet are expected to jump as much as 6 degrees, if not by the end of this century, then sometime during the next, with the oceans acidifying not on the scale of thousands of years but within decades. ^ref-22082

## Highlight

Mount Pinatubo was the 1991 volcano in the Philippines that, when it exploded, lowered the global temperature by half a degree Celsius for three years. Pumping sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere is currently being pitched as a controversial geoengineering solution to global warming. (One reason it’s controversial is that it does nothing to address ocean acidification.) ^ref-43292

At the end of the Cretaceous, the largest asteroid known to have hit any planet in the solar system in a half-billion years hit Earth . . . At virtually the same time that one of the largest volcanic eruptions ever smothered parts of India in lava more than 2 miles deep. ^ref-22373

## Highlight

Seeds in fruit are designed to be eaten and dispersed by animals, but for the avocado this makes little sense. Their billiard ball–sized cores, if swallowed whole, would at the very least make for an agonizing few days of digestive transit. But the fruit makes a little more sense in a land populated by tree-foraging giants, like the sometimes dinosaur-proportioned ground sloths, who swallowed the seeds and hardly noticed them. ^ref-2034
