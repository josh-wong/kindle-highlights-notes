## Highlight

Fighting fear doesn't work.  It just drags us in closer.  One has to focus on what is real.  On the truth.  When in darkness, don't fight it.  You can't win.  Just find the nearest switch, turn on the light. ^ref-21390

If something else feels true for you, then do that.  I really don't think the details matter.  What matters is the practice, the commitment to living your truth. ^ref-28890
