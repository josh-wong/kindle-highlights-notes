## Highlight

IA allows us to think about problems through two important perspectives: that information products and services are perceived by people as places made of information, and that these information environments can be organized for optimum findability and understandability. ^ref-55428

## Highlight

The career of Richard Saul Wurman—originator of the term “information architect”—is based on using design to address information overload. His book Information Anxiety2 is considered a classic in the field. ^ref-54172

## Highlight

Increasingly, organizations have to consider how users will access their information in these and many other wildly different contexts. They will obviously want these experiences to be consistent and coherent regardless of where and how the information is being accessed. ^ref-27217

## Highlight

What is needed is a systematic, comprehensive, holistic approach to structuring information in a way that makes it easy to find and understand—regardless of the context, channel, or medium the user employs to access it. ^ref-46556
- Location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=459)

## Highlight

Digital experiences are new (and very real) types of places made of information; the design challenge lies in making them be coherent across multiple contexts. ^ref-2997

## Highlight

information architecture asks designers to define semantic structures that can be instantiated in multiple ways depending on the needs of different channels. ^ref-20890

---
## Highlight

A navigation structure that works well in a desktop web page should function differently when presented on a five-inch touchscreen, but the user’s experience with both should be coherent (Figure 1-7). ^ref-9113

## Highlight

In other words, when an organization serves its users via multiple channels, the users’ experiences across those channels should be consistent and familiar. ^ref-13677

---
## Highlight

Effective information environments strike a balance between structural coherence (high-level invariance) and suppleness (low-level flexibility), so well-designed information architectures consider both. ^ref-11227

## Highlight

Information architecture is focused on making information findable and understandable. ^ref-37387

## Highlight

It does this by asking the designer to think about problems through two important perspectives: that our products and services are perceived as places made of information, and that they function as ecosystems that can be designed for maximum effectiveness. ^ref-55029

---
## Highlight

Let’s start by clarifying what we mean by information architecture: The structural design of shared information environments The synthesis of organization, labeling, search, and navigation systems within digital, physical, and cross-channel ecosystems The art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability, findability, and understanding An emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape ^ref-46653

## Highlight

Users. Content. Context. You’ll hear these three words again and again throughout this book. They form the basis of our model for practicing effective information architecture design. ^ref-65272

## Highlight

An architect can’t huddle in a dark room with a bunch of content, organize it, and emerge with a grand solution. It simply won’t hold up against the light of day. ^ref-29577
- Location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=704)

---
## Highlight

We use the concept of an “information ecology”3 composed of users, content, and context to address the complex dependencies that exist in these information environments. And we draw upon our trusty Venn diagram (see Figure 2-6) to help people visualize and understand these relationships. The three circles illustrate the interdependent nature of users, content, and context within a complex, adaptive information ecology. Figure 2-6. The infamous three circles of information architecture ^ref-58707

## Highlight

Differences in customer preferences and behaviors within the physical world translate into different information needs and information-seeking behaviors in the context of websites and apps. For example, senior executives may need to find a few good documents on a particular topic very quickly. Research analysts may need to find all the relevant documents and may be willing to spend several hours on the hunt. Managers may have a high level of industry knowledge but low navigation and searching proficiency. Teenagers may be new to the subject area but skilled in handling a search engine. ^ref-1564

## Highlight

Do you know who’s using your system? Do you know how they’re using it? And perhaps most importantly, do you know what information they want from your systems? ^ref-55964
- Location: [824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=824)

---
## Highlight

Information architecture starts with people and the reason they come to your site or use your app: they have an information need. ^ref-11569
- Location: [856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=856)

---
## Highlight

There is no goal more important to designing information architecture than to satisfy peoples’ needs. ^ref-14321
- Location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=862)

---
## Highlight

Searching, browsing, and asking are all methods for finding, and these are the basic building blocks of information-seeking behavior. ^ref-6893
- Location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=966)

---
## Highlight

If the berry-picking model is common to your users, you’ll want to look for ways to support moving easily from search to browse and back again. Amazon.com provides one such integrated approach to consider: you can search within the categories you find through browsing, and you can browse through categories that you find by searching, as shown in Figure 3-5. Figure 3-5. Browsing and searching are tightly integrated on Amazon.com ^ref-50469
- Location: [996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=996)

---
## Highlight

Another useful model is the “pearl-growing” approach. Users start with one or a few good documents that are exactly what they need. They want to get “more like this one.” ^ref-45530
- Location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1002)

---
## Highlight

How can we learn about users’ information needs and seeking behaviors? There are a variety of user research methods to consider—too many to cover in detail here—so we’ll recommend a pair of our favorites: search analytics and contextual inquiry. Search analytics2 involves reviewing the most common search queries on your site (usually stored in your search engine’s logfiles) as a way to diagnose problems with search performance, metadata, navigation, and content. Search analytics provides a sense of what users commonly seek, and can help inform your understanding of their information needs and seeking behaviors (and it’s handy in other ways, too, such as developing task-analysis exercises). ^ref-62508

## Highlight

The structure of information environments influences more than how we find stuff: it also changes how we understand it. ^ref-37322
- Location: [1374](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1374)

## Highlight

When designing information environments, we can learn from the design of physical environments. ^ref-9503

---
## Highlight

Why is it important to be able to visualize information architecture? As we mentioned in Chapter 2, the field is abstract, and many who might conceptually understand the basic premise of information architecture won’t really “get it” until they see it and experience it. Also, a well-designed information architecture is invisible to users (which, paradoxically, is quite an unfair reward for IA success). ^ref-36282
- Location: [1415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1415)

---
## Highlight

You might be surprised by how much information architecture you can see if you know how to look. For example, the information has been structured in some basic ways, which we’ll explain further in later chapters: Organization systems present the site’s information to us in a variety of ways, such as content categories that pertain to the entire campus (e.g., the top bar and its “Academics” and “Admission” choices), or to specific audiences (the block on the middle left, with such choices as “Future Students” and “Staff”). Navigation systems help users move through the content, such as with the custom organization of the individual drop-down menus in the main navigation bar. Search systems allow users to search the content; when the user starts typing in the site’s search bar, a list of suggestions is shown with possible matches for the user’s search term. Labeling systems describe categories, options, and links in language that (hopefully) is meaningful to users; you’ll see examples throughout the page (e.g., “Admission,” “Alumni,” “Events”). ^ref-55427
- Location: [1440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1440)

---
## Highlight

A good information architecture is designed to anticipate this type of use; Keith Instone’s simple and practical “navigation stress test” is a great way to evaluate a site’s bottom-up information architecture. ^ref-48932
- Location: [1499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1499)

### Note
Refer to this stress test in the future when organizing documentation.

## Highlight

Our understanding of the world is largely determined by our ability to organize information. Where do you live? What do you do? Who are you? Our answers reveal the systems of classification that form the very foundations of our understanding. We live in towns within states within countries. We work in departments in companies in industries. We are parents, children, and siblings, each an integral part of a family tree. We organize to understand, to explain, and to control. ^ref-61503
- Location: [1687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1687)

---
## Highlight

In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on the challenge of organizing information. Yet this challenge is not new. People have struggled with the difficulties of information organization for centuries. The field of librarianship has been largely devoted to the task of organizing and providing access to information. So why all the fuss now? Believe it or not, we’re all becoming librarians. This quiet yet powerful revolution is driven by the decentralizing force of the global Internet. Not long ago, the responsibility for labeling, organizing, and providing access to information fell squarely in the laps of librarians. ^ref-27986
- Location: [1705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1705)

---
## Highlight

As the Internet provides users with the freedom to publish information, it quietly burdens them with the responsibility to organize that information. New information technologies open the floodgates for exponential content growth, which creates a need for innovation in content organization (see Figure 6-1 ^ref-1456
- Location: [1714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1714)

### Note
Very true. Along with content creation and information sharing, we also need to consider how that content and information is organized.

---
## Highlight

It is difficult and often misguided to attempt a one-size-fits-all approach to the organization of heterogeneous content. This is a fundamental flaw of many enterprise taxonomy initiatives. ^ref-33291
- Location: [1764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1764)

---
## Highlight

We employ a mix of user research and analysis methods to gain real insight. How do users group the information? What types of labels do they use? How do they navigate? This challenge is complicated by the fact that most information environments are designed for multiple users, and all users will have different ways of understanding the information. Their levels of familiarity with your company and your content will vary. For these reasons, even with a massive barrage of user tests, it is impossible to create a perfect organization system. One system does not fit all! However, by recognizing the importance of perspective, by striving to understand the intended audiences through user research and testing, and by providing multiple navigation pathways, you can do a better job of organizing information for public consumption than your coworker does on his desktop computer. ^ref-46926
- Location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=1780)

---
## Highlight

There’s a simple reason why people find ambiguous organization schemes so useful: we don’t always know what we’re looking for. In some cases, you simply don’t know the correct label. In others, you may have only a vague information need that you can’t quite articulate. As we mentioned in Chapter 3, information seeking is often iterative and interactive. What you find at the beginning of your search may influence what you look for and find later in your search. This information-seeking process can involve a wonderful element of associative learning. Seek and ye shall find, but if the system is well designed, you also might learn along the way. ^ref-2940

## Highlight

In contrast to breadth, when considering depth, you should be even more conservative. If users are forced to click through more than two or three levels, they may simply give up and leave your website. At the very least, they’ll become frustrated. An excellent study conducted by Microsoft Research suggests that a balance of breadth and depth may provide the best results. ^ref-25946

---
## Highlight

For these reasons, hypertext is rarely a good candidate for the primary organization structure. Rather, it can be used to complement structures based upon the hierarchical or database models. Hypertext allows for useful and creative relationships between items and areas in the hierarchy. It usually makes sense to first design the information hierarchy and then identify ways in which hypertext can complement the hierarchy. ^ref-2186
- Location: [2166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=2166)

### Note
This seems to be the opposite of what many in personal knowledge management follow.

---
## Highlight

Iconic labels like these add aesthetic appeal to an information environment, and as long as they don’t compromise the system’s usability, there’s no reason not to use them. In fact, the iconic “language” might get established in your users’ minds through repeated exposure. In such situations, icons are especially useful shorthand, both representational and easy to visually recognize—a double bonus. Unless your system has a patient, loyal audience of users who are willing to learn your visual language, however, we suggest using iconic labels only for environments with a limited set of options, being careful not to place form ahead of function. ^ref-20472
- Location: [2579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=2579)

---
## Highlight

We expect that as more people and devices become connected through these networks, dynamically generated social navigation systems will become increasingly complex, sophisticated, and useful. As a result, organizations will find new ways of tailoring the navigation structures of information environments to better serve the needs of individual users. However, we must be careful to not go overboard: systems that are too precisely tuned to the preferences of any one particular user’s social groups can easily devolve into echo chambers that downplay alternative points of view. ^ref-63872
- Location: [3622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=3622)

### Note
We've reached this point already, probably around 2017 or 2018.

## Highlight

Building context—allowing users to locate their positions within the system—is a critical function of navigation systems. ^ref-58864
- Location: [3636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=3636)

---
## Highlight

Because many developers see search engines as the solution to the problems users have when trying to find information in their products, search engines become Band-Aids for poorly designed navigation systems and other architectural weaknesses. If you see yourself falling into this trap, you should probably suspend implementing your search system until you fix your navigation system’s problems. You’ll find that search systems often perform better if they can take advantage of aspects of strong navigation systems, such as the controlled vocabulary terms used to tag content. And users will often benefit even more from using both types of finding if they work together well. Of course, your product’s navigation might be a disaster for political reasons, such as an inability among your organization’s decision makers to agree on a system-wide navigation system. In such cases, reality trumps what ought to be, and search might indeed be your best alternative. ^ref-40268

---
## Highlight

Search helps fragmented sites Powell’s room after room after room of books is also a good analogy for the silos of content that make up so many intranets and large public websites. As is so often the case, each business unit has gone ahead and done its own thing, developing content haphazardly with few (if any) standards, and probably no metadata to support any sort of reasonable browsing. If this describes your situation, you have a long road ahead of you, and search won’t solve all of your problems—let alone your users’ problems. But your priority should be to set up a search system to perform full-text indexing of as much system content as possible, even across such traditional silos as company departments. Even if it’s only a stopgap, search will address your users’ dire need for finding information regardless of which business unit actually owns it. Search will also help you to get a better handle on what content is actually out there. ^ref-40576

## Highlight

And last but not least is administration, the continuous evaluation and improvement of the system’s information architecture. Administration includes the daily tasks of tagging new documents and weeding out old ones. It also requires monitoring usage and user feedback, identifying opportunities to improve through major or minor adjustments. Effective administration can make a good information environment great. ^ref-43717

## Highlight

A heuristic evaluation is an expert critique that tests a product or service against a set of design guidelines. It’s usually best to have someone outside the organization perform this critique, so this person is able to look with fresh eyes and be largely unburdened with political considerations. Ideally, the heuristic evaluation should occur before a review of background materials to avoid bias. At its simplest, a heuristic evaluation of an information architecture involves one expert reviewing an information environment and identifying major problems and opportunities for improvement. This expert brings to the table an unwritten set of assumptions about what does and doesn’t work, drawing upon experiences with many projects in many organizations. ^ref-30799

## Highlight

Benchmarking can also be applied to a single information environment over time to measure improvements. We can use it to answer such return-on-investment (ROI) questions as: How much did the intranet redesign reduce our employees’ average time finding core documents? Has the website redesign improved our customers’ ability to find the products they need? Which aspects of our redesign have had a negative impact on user efficiency or effectiveness? ^ref-5156

---
## Highlight

The advantages of before-and-after benchmarking include the following: Identifies and prioritizes information architecture features in the existing environment Encourages transition from broad generalizations (e.g., “Our site’s navigation stinks”) to specific, actionable definitions (“The label of this link should be updated because our testers didn’t know what it meant”) Creates a point of reference against which you can measure improvements ^ref-10595
- Location: [5533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=5533)

---
## Highlight

On the other hand, competitive benchmarking offers these benefits: Generates a laundry list of information architecture features, bringing lots of new ideas to table Encourages transition from broad generalizations (e.g., “Amazon is a good model”) to specific, actionable definitions (“Amazon’s personalization feature works well for frequent visitors”) Challenges embedded assumptions (e.g., “We should be like Fidelity”) and avoids copying the wrong features for the wrong reasons Establishes current position with respect to competitors and creates a point of reference against which to measure speed of improvement ^ref-29859

## Highlight

As you consider integrating these user research methods into your design process, keep a couple of things in mind. First, observe the golden rule of discount usability engineering: any testing is better than no testing. Don’t let budgets or schedules become an excuse. Second, remember that users can be your most powerful allies. It’s easy for your colleagues and your boss to argue with you, but it’s difficult for them to argue with their customers and with real user behavior. User research is an extremely effective political tool. ^ref-11911

## Highlight

An information architecture strategy is a high-level conceptual framework for structuring and organizing an information environment. It provides the firm sense of direction and scope necessary to proceed with confidence into the design and implementation phases. It also facilitates discussion and helps get people on the same page before moving into the more expensive design phase. Just as the operating plans of each department should be driven by a unifying business strategy, your information architecture should be driven by a holistic IA strategy. To succeed, you need a strategy that will work within the unique information ecology at hand. Based upon the results of your research into context, people, and content, you’re striving to design a strategy that balances the needs and realities of each. ^ref-27342
- Location: [5939](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B015D78JV6&location=5939)

---
## Highlight

We often find it useful to go beyond the content management discussion and actually create a project plan for information architecture design as part of the strategy phase deliverables. This project plan can accomplish two major objectives. First, when developed in parallel with the strategy report, it forces the team to constantly ask questions such as: How will we accomplish that? How long will it take? Who will do it? What kinds of deliverables will be required? What are the dependencies? This ensures that information architecture strategy is grounded in reality. The second objective of the project plan is to form the bridge between strategy and design. It can be integrated with plans from other teams (e.g., interaction design, content authoring, or application development) toward the development of a structured schedule for overall site design. ^ref-47336

## Highlight

An information architecture strategy serves as a bridge between research and design. The IA strategy provides a high-level conceptual framework for structuring and organizing an information environment. You should start considering possible strategies for structuring and organizing the product before research begins. The main deliverable of the strategy phase is the strategy report. We find it useful to create a project plan for the design of the information architecture as part of the strategy phase. You’re not done when you’ve created the report—you also need to present and discuss it with stakeholders. ^ref-19944

## Highlight

An architecture style guide is a document that explains how the environment is organized, why it is organized that way, who it’s for, and how the architecture should be extended as the system grows. You should begin your guide with documentation of the mission and vision for the product, as it’s important to understand the original goals. Continue with information about the intended audiences. Who was it designed for? What are their goals? What assumptions were made about their information needs? Then, follow up with a description of the content development policy. What types of content will and won’t be included, and why? How often will it be updated? When will it be removed? And who will be responsible for it? ^ref-47871
