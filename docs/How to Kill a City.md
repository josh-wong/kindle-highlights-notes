## Highlight

Gentrification is a system that places the needs of capital (both in terms of city budget and in terms of real estate profits) above the needs of people. ^ref-30628

## Highlight

Gentrification, at its deepest level, is really about reorienting the purpose of cities away from being spaces that provide for the poor and middle classes and toward being spaces that generate capital for the rich. ^ref-57241

### Note
We see this in Tokyo as well. For example, Monzennakacho and Kiyosumi-Shirakawa were traditionally working-class districts. Now they are becoming fashionable places, with stylish cafes, bars, and boutiques.

## Highlight

Before Katrina, the Lower Ninth was nearly 100 percent black, and despite its reputation as being a poor section of the city, it was actually mostly middle-income—the median area income at the 2000 census was $37,894. The area had one of the highest rates of African American homeownership in the country. During Katrina, the concrete barriers holding water back from the Industrial Canal broke, flooding the entire neighborhood, destroying the vast majority of its homes, and killing a thousand people in the Lower Ninth alone. After the storm, residents reported hearing loud booms as the storm encroached, and rumors flew over whether the levees holding back the Industrial Canal had been deliberately blown in order to save richer areas of the city. ^ref-35810

## Highlight

There’s some evidence that historically this phase of gentrification was often spearheaded by gays and lesbians in search of safe spaces outside homogenized suburbia where they could congregate. San Francisco experienced an influx of gays during World War II, thanks in part to the military’s practice of dishonorably discharging gay men into the city via military bases on the Pacific Ocean. ^ref-19819

## Highlight

Using the rent gap theory, Smith was able to accurately predict the gentrification of many New York neighborhoods, including the Lower East Side, Harlem, and Park Slope. He looked at tax arrears data and found that gentrification happened right after buildings hit their highest level of tax debt—a sign landlords were milking their buildings by not doing repairs or paying their taxes in preparation for flipping them. ^ref-39170

## Highlight

There’s no federal mandate that suggests the government should attempt to return people home after a disaster. So Katrina’s victims were given housing anywhere it was available. ^ref-31708

## Highlight

One state representative went as far as to say that public housing residents should be sterilized. And former US representative Richard Baker, who’d represented Baton Rouge for ten terms, said: “We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans.… We couldn’t do it, but God did.” ^ref-25516

## Highlight

Road Home, Louisiana’s main program meant to help homeowners rebuild their houses, was meant to distribute billions of dollars from the federal government. But by 2008, two-thirds of the funds hadn’t yet been doled out. And in 2011, a court found that Road Home distributed grants in a racially biased way, awarding homeowners in majority-white neighborhoods more money to rebuild than those with similar homes in majority-black neighborhoods. ^ref-40676

## Highlight

If you look toward San Francisco and New York, cities that have a few decades of gentrification under their belts, you’ll see that the gentrifiers—punks, artists, LGBT communities—are inevitably replaced by a flood of hipsters with more money, and those hipsters with more money are then pushed out by yuppies with even more money. ^ref-50377

### Note
Is this factual? It sounds presumptuous.

## Highlight

Freret feels like so many gentrifying neighborhoods in US cities. If you spun around a couple of times, you might think you were in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or San Francisco’s Mission District. The Mojo Coffee on one of Freret’s corners could be in Brooklyn or Portland, or really anywhere with enough twentysomethings with MacBooks to sustain a business that makes most of its money from $4 cups of coffee. The tattoo place could come from Austin, Texas. The burger joint could be in Uptown Minneapolis. In the same way the outskirts of every city host a confluence of chain stores—Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, OfficeMax—every city now seems to contain a Freret Street. ^ref-25482

### Note
More bitterness by the author without considering any positives from this aspect of gentrificaton (e.g., job growth and crime reduction).

## Highlight

When I asked if John and Alicia saw themselves—two young white transplants making enough money to buy a $370,000 house—as gentrifiers, both said they’d never thought about it, but that perhaps they were. “I don’t know if we’re doing the same thing as in Dalston,” John said. “But maybe we’re the pricks changing the neighborhood. Sometimes I feel guilty and wonder if the neighbors think, ‘There goes the neighborhood’ when they see me.” ^ref-20240
- Location: [1022](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MXXCDVV&location=1022)

### Note
The author focuses too much on projecting white guilt, especially here. Blame is put on governments, corporations, and white people, but a city and its people (e.g., eduation and societal values) are not considered in retrospect.

## Highlight

His shop is not meant for gentrifiers—nothing prevents them from coming in, but Dennis makes no effort to attract them. His employees are black, and from what I could tell, so are all of his customers. The shop is busy, Dennis said, but less busy than it used to be. Yet he sees new businesses catering to white people opening constantly. “Our customers are getting further and further away,” he said. “We’re struggling. But the welcome mat is rolled out for the newcomers.” ^ref-28663

### Note
This part makes no sense. You can't say that you don't care about attacting a demographic and then later say you're struggling and have the welcome mat for the people you don't care about having as customers.

### Note
Note to self: Stopped here. This book looks at gentrification at only one angle and continuously beats that argument into the ground. Also, the finger-pointing at specific demographics (whether caucasian, hipster, or rich) is off-putting. This book has not been an enjoyable or enlightening read.
