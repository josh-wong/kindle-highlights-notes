## Highlight

To get better results with content today, we must look at it through the lens of our customers. We have to map content to the intent and scenario of the people we hope to reach. When we understand intent and scenario, we have a better chance of creating remarkable content. ^ref-40645

## Highlight

Email generally produces more long-term customers than social media. This is because people still prefer the personable touch of email. ^ref-64890

### Note
Without more data, I'm not so sure this is true. Many email marketing campaigns have cumbersome or ineffective unsubscribe processes. Because of this, I think email seems to show more loyalty because people are more likely to label marketing email as junk or delete it, appearing S "subscribed" in the marketer's eyes.

## Highlight

Companies that continue to play by the old rule of one-way conversations struggle on social media. The best brands engage. They activate the tribal power of social networks to increase reach and resonance. Above all, social media is a great way to listen to customers and identify opportunities for innovation and improvement. The best social media pages listen, engage, and delight. They seek to put the social back in social media. ^ref-14619
