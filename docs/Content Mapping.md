## Highlight

To get better results with content today, we must look at it through the lens of our customers. We have to map content to the intent and scenario of the people we hope to reach. When we understand intent and scenario, we have a better chance of creating remarkable content. ^ref-40645

## Highlight

The effort we put into developing personas paid off. We now had a clear understanding of our target audience whenever we created content. This helped us increase content quality and engagement. ^ref-932

## Highlight

Email generally produces more long-term customers than social media. This is because people still prefer the personable touch of email. ^ref-64890

### Note
Without more data, I'm not so sure this is true. Many email marketing campaigns have cumbersome or ineffective unsubscribe processes. Because of this, I think email seems to show more loyalty because people are more likely to label marketing email as junk or delete it, appearing S "subscribed" in the marketer's eyes.

## Highlight

Companies that continue to play by the old rule of one-way conversations struggle on social media. The best brands engage. They activate the tribal power of social networks to increase reach and resonance. Above all, social media is a great way to listen to customers and identify opportunities for innovation and improvement. The best social media pages listen, engage, and delight. They seek to put the social back in social media. ^ref-14619

## Highlight

“Don’t just create content to get credit for being clever—create content that will be helpful, insightful, or interesting for your target audience.” David Ogilvy (“The Father of Advertising”) ^ref-55501

## Highlight

Customers don’t want a product or a service; they want a solution. This is what Professor Levitt meant when he said, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill; they want a quarter-inch hole.” ^ref-4180

## Highlight

Go beyond the why of what you do and lean into the why of the customer’s needs. Why should they take your offer? Is it because it brings them closer to a solution? Is it because it promises a transformation? ^ref-50997

## Highlight

Revisit your personas and your content map at least once a quarter to make sure their needs still hold true. As you receive new inputs from your organization and the marketplace, adapt your personas and strategies accordingly. ^ref-32160

### Note
This practice seems like a best-case, ideal scenario. In reality, this would be significantly time consuming. I think reviewing personas once every six months and as needed (major product revisions, etc.) would be sufficient.
