## Highlight

In 1968, Baba Dioum, a Senegalese forest ranger, provided a memorable answer. “In the end,” he said, “we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.” ^ref-62796

## Highlight

Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up some 95 percent of all that exists, enigmatic constituents that we can’t detect but which are thought to have played a major role in shaping the universe. ^ref-31554

## Highlight

If light chronicles the history of the universe, rocks tell our planet’s story. When you gaze into the Grand Canyon or marvel at the peaks framing Lake Louise, you’re viewing nature’s library, with volumes of Earth history on display, inscribed in stone. Sediments—cobbles, sands, or muds formed by erosion of earlier rocks, or limestones precipitated from water bodies—spread across floodplains and the seafloor, recording, layer upon layer, the physical, chemical, and biological features of our planet’s surface at the time and place they formed. Igneous rocks—formed from molten materials deep inside the Earth—tell us more about our planet’s dynamic interior, as do metamorphic rocks forged from sedimentary or igneous precursors at elevated temperature and pressure deep within the Earth. Collectively, these rocks offer a grand narrative of Earth’s development from youth to maturity, of life’s evolution from bacteria to you, and—perhaps the grandest narrative of all—of the ways that the physical and biological Earth have influenced each other through time. ^ref-10466

## Highlight

Our planet coalesced some 4.54 billion years ago, but Earth’s oldest known rocks date back only to about 4 billion years. Older rocks must have existed, but they’ve been eroded away or were buried and transformed through metamorphism into unrecognizable form. A few may still lie in some remote Canadian or Siberian hillside, waiting to be recognized, but largely, the first 600 million years of Earth history constitutes our planet’s Dark Age. ^ref-41339

## Highlight

A few tens of millions of years after Earth had mostly accreted, a Mars-size body rammed into our infant planet, flinging rock and gas into space. Much of the ejected material eventually coalesced to form a relatively small rocky sphere, locked into permanent orbit around the Earth. The full moon may inspire poetry, but it was born in violence, its secrets unlocked through careful studies of lunar rocks. ^ref-53195

## Highlight

Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.47 billion years, meaning that on this timescale half of the uranium-238 in a sample will have decayed to lead-206; similarly, uranium-235 has a half-life of 710 million years. Because no lead entered the zircons as they formed, any lead we measure in them today must have formed by the radioactive decay of uranium. So, by the careful measurement of uranium and lead in zircons, we gain a clock, Earth’s best chronometer for calibrating our planet’s deep history. ^ref-51112

## Highlight

Chondritic meteorites, then, provide a source of water and carbon, and unlike comets, they pass the hydrogen isotope test. Thus it looks like chondritic meteorites of different kinds provided most of the rock, water, and air that we call home. ^ref-17438

## Highlight

Similarly, proteins—such good food for bacteria and fungi—are rarely preserved in any but the youngest rocks. What do preserve are lipids, those hardy constituents of membranes. I’m fond of telling students that when they die, the last bits of them that will remain for future generations to ponder will be their cholesterol! ^ref-60084

## Highlight

Had you lived at the time of Christ or a thousand years later, your life and, indeed, the human impact on our planet would have been broadly similar. Our numbers didn’t change much over that interval, hovering around 200 million. As humans learned to exploit the energy resources beneath our feet, however, the trajectories of population size, technological innovation, and environmental influence moved into high gear—in less than two centuries, we went from horse power and steam to gasoline and jet fuel. The human population passed the billion point around 1800, reaching two billion by 1930, and four billion in 1975. We’re on course to complete another doubling in the coming decade. And as our population has grown, the environmental impact of each individual has expanded remarkably. Fossil fuels have been extracted since the nineteenth century, but their use has increased nearly tenfold since World War II. ^ref-43284

## Highlight

Nearly two billion people who depend on seasonal melt from mountain glaciers in low latitudes will also see water availability dwindle as the glaciers that sustain them shrink and eventually disappear. ^ref-56258
