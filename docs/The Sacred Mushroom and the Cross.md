## Highlight

This book shows the power and persistence of this idea, and of the fertility cults and rituals by which people tried to attain divine vision and know the mind of their God. Central to such cults, over thousands of years and across continenrts, has been the use of entheogens (psychoactive substances derived from plants) to reach a higher consciousness, a sense of community with the gods. One of the chief sources was the sacred mushroom, Amanita muscariaâ€”at once the symbol and embodiment of fertility, and the means to understand it.
