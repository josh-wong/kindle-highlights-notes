## Highlight

Once the danger passes, the body returns to a state of equilibrium called homeostasis. So short-term stress—called episodic stress—can be a good thing. ^ref-29534

## Highlight

Under stress, your body will produce an excessive amount of cortisol (technically called hydrocortisone). This hormone is essential for life and does you much good—in moderate doses. But a continual flood of it weakens your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection. It slows down your bone cell growth, which over time can lead to osteoporosis. It drains potassium from your cells and makes it more difficult for your intestines to absorb calcium. It interrupts normal reproductive functions such as menstruation and the production of estrogen and testosterone. It causes you to retain water and store excess fat. It also hurts your brain. After about thirty minutes of stress and prolonged exposure to cortisol, the energy supply to the memory center of the brain, the hippocampus, drops by about 25 percent. Eventually, the neurons in the hippocampus begin to die. The result is that under high or prolonged stress, memory and concentration are impaired. You literally don’t think as well as you used to. Your thoughts become more superficial, less rational. ^ref-22643

## Highlight

We activate the stress response when we send our minds into the future or the past and include threat thoughts into the mix of those future or past thoughts. Worrying, for example, involves thinking of a future event and including a painful scenario in the stream of future thoughts. Regret is essentially doing the same thing but in the opposite direction, into our past. ^ref-32044

## Highlight

And here is why mindfulness is so powerful: The instant we do this, we leave behind threat thoughts of the future or the past, because here and now is safe. As we sense the safety of here and now, the stress response automatically turns off. ^ref-8120

## Highlight

Mindfulness implies that we cease consuming the present by beating ourselves up over the past and the future. Remember, we can focus only on one thing at a time. The present moment, here and now, is not stressful. The past and the future can be. But you have a choice about which one you want to think about. ^ref-40363

## Highlight

Let go of your need to judge anything that you observe. Observe everything that presents itself to your senses the same way you would look at a rainbow, a starry night, or a sunset without judging, analyzing, or comparing. If you notice any stressful thoughts creeping back in, return to a full focus on your senses. ^ref-29858

## Highlight

people with the reactive paradigm are far more stressed out than they need to be. The root of their stress is their beliefs. ^ref-13667

## Highlight

Proactive people know that even though they can’t control the external world, the external world doesn’t control them. They are secure in the knowledge that there are certain principles in life that are timeless and unchanging—and they seek to live by those principles. Living a principle-centered life is the best stress-prevention tool we know. ^ref-27628

## Highlight

Most people can’t turn off their sympathy for other human beings. Hurting people leaves scars on both the giver and the receiver. As a result, unethical people have stormier internal lives because they have to work to suppress their consciences and sympathies to deal with the ways they treat others. When they fail to properly suppress their sympathies, the guilt and shame that comes with harming or disrespecting one’s fellow human beings takes deep root within them.40 ^ref-39157

## Highlight

What matters most to you in life? What is most important to you, and what do you value the most? What value, idea, or principle has such great worth that you would dedicate your life to be able to live by that principle? ^ref-5350

## Highlight

The paradigm of hassle is that life is a battle, and in every battle there’s a winner and a loser. You’ve got to compete or die. But for a person with a paradigm of harmony, life is not a competition. Everyone can win. No one really has to lose in order for me to win. ^ref-48033

## Highlight

Empathy is understanding what others feel. Sympathy is feeling sorry for others and comforting them. ^ref-39641

## Highlight

But the rise of social media has the paradoxical effect of discouraging personal contact with others. ^ref-27305

## Highlight

If you have the diversity paradigm, you won’t stress out when facing a difference of opinion. Instead, you will say, “You have a different opinion. I need to understand it.” That question by itself eliminates virtually all the stress in any interaction. And it’s an honest question. ^ref-63858

## Highlight

Research on guided imagery has shown that it is effective in providing relief from chronic pain, headaches, and even asthma. It has also been shown to work on people with chemical dependencies and athletes suffering slumps in performance. ^ref-48359

## Highlight

Remember, the quality of a good meditation is not necessarily what happens during the meditation. The important issue is how you feel after meditating. If you have more energy, more alertness, if your mind is calmer, more peaceful, and you feel happier, this is feedback that your mind/body enjoys and finds benefit from the meditation. ^ref-44881
