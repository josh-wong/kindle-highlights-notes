## Highlight

**20:27:** So complex behavior doesn't necessarily shed light on whether a system is conscious or not. We can probe our intuitions about behavior from another angle by asking, "Does a system need to be conscious to exhibit certain behaviors?" For instance, would an advanced robot need to be conscious to give its owner a pat on the back when witnesses her crying? Most of us would answer, "Not necessarily."

**26:48:** As the Neuroscientist David Eagleman puts it, “Your perception of reality is the end result of fancy editing tricks. The brain hides the difference in arrival times. How? What it serves up in reality is actually a delayed version. Your brain collects up all the information from the senses before it decides upon a story of what happens. The strange consequence of all this is that you live in the past. By the time you think the moment occurs, it’s already long gone. To synchronize the incoming information from the senses, the cost is that our conscious awareness lags behind the physical world.
