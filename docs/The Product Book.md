## Highlight

Put simply, a product manager (PM) represents the customer. No one buys a product because they want to give the company money. Customers buy and use products because the products address their needs. Done properly, the products let the customers be awesome. The end result of representing the customer is that a PM helps the customer be awesome. ^ref-55428

---
## Highlight

Day to day, PMs must understand both business strategy and execution. They must first figure out who the customers are and what problems the customers have. They must know how to set a vision, finding the right opportunities in a sea of possibilities, by using both data and intuition. They must know how to define success, for the customer and the product, by prioritizing doing what is right over doing what is easy. ^ref-15506

## Highlight

PMs manage products, not people, so they must achieve everything using soft influence, effective communication, leadership, and trust—not orders. ^ref-54322

Project managers are masters of schedules and Gantt charts, not of representing customers. ^ref-57604

## Highlight

Product managers are like the conductor in an orchestra. The conductor never makes a sound but is responsible for making the orchestra as a whole sound awesome to deliver a great performance to the audience. Great conductors understand and engage with everyone in the orchestra, using the right vocabulary with each section, diplomatically moving everyone together toward the shared goal of a great performance. ^ref-38212

## Highlight

The most common approach you’ll encounter is a hybrid of waterfall and lean where the PM will plan a bit upfront to find the right opportunity, but then the teams will implement the product in an iterative way. This is nice because it lets you keep a big-picture goal in mind, but change course if needed such as if you find a significant technical obstacle or find that customers don’t want the product you’re building. We’ll mainly focus on a hybrid approach in this book. ^ref-40729

---
## Highlight

Every product goes through five key conceptual stages: 1. Finding and planning the right opportunity 2. Designing the solution 3. Building the solution 4. Sharing the solution 5. Assessing the solution Put another way, this process involves figuring out what problem to work on, figuring out how to solve it, building the solution, getting it in customers’ hands, and seeing if it worked for them. ^ref-23718

## Highlight

The very first phase of the product-development life cycle is to find and clearly define the next opportunity to pursue. The world’s a sea of possibilities! What should you build next? Usually, it’s up to the product manager to create and sort through all the possibilities, picking the right one to focus on next. ^ref-24636

## Highlight

At a high level, company goals fall into three categories: growth, revenue, and customer satisfaction. Specifically, does the company want to get more users for the product, increase its revenue from the current customers, or make its current customers happier? If the goal is revenue, how does the company currently monetize their product, and how can you increase the value for customers to make them more willing to pay for the product? If the goal is growth, what’s stopping new customers from using the product? If the goal is to delight their customers, what can you deliver that they would love, but wouldn’t expect? By understanding the current goals you can think strategically, and make sure the products you’re building align with those goals, helping the company be successful. ^ref-28939

Scoping means clearly defining the opportunity and the customers you want to target, along with the requirements for the solution. ^ref-62545

## Highlight

Most companies using a hybrid model never build a true MVP, but rather an MVP with some extra key features they believe will make the product more enticing. If you know for certain customers will want those key features, incorporating them from the start will help shorten the iteration cycle. ^ref-33775
- Location: [287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071HFBGXR&location=287)

---
## Highlight

Product managers create a document that encompasses the entire planning phase, called a product requirements document (PRD), collecting all this planning information in one spot. A PRD contains the explanation for why you’re pursuing this opportunity, the scoped problem definition, the success metrics, and more. But you don’t create the PRD in isolation—you’ll work with your team, your boss, and other product stakeholders to make sure the opportunity and requirements are clear and the goals are achievable. ^ref-2122
- Location: [304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071HFBGXR&location=304)

---
## Highlight

In the hybrid model, the PRD is treated as a great communications tool to get everyone on the same page and as a living—not dictating—document. Over the product-development life cycle, the PRD will expand to contain more information, but it starts by clearly stating the problem and why we’re working on it. When the product’s built, the PRD provides a great reference for the sales and support teams to understand what’s in the product and why. ^ref-40696

## Highlight

Contrary to popular belief, design doesn’t just mean what the solution looks like. Design involves aspects like information architecture (In what order are things presented to the user?), wireframes (Where should the information live on the screen?), and pixels (How does it look?). ^ref-44881

## Highlight

Engineers hate taking on technical debt—they want to write a complete answer from the outset. If you come from an engineering background, taking on technical debt can be hard. As a PM, you’ll often have to make hard tradeoff decisions, accepting short-term debt to provide customer value faster. The opposite is true as well, which is hard for PMs from a non-technical background. You’ll have to pay off that debt later—cleaning up the code—otherwise the code can get unwieldy, and it can become very hard to iterate on the project. ^ref-26689

---
## Highlight

while Design will have figured out the most common use cases in the prototyping stage, there are likely many edge cases that will come up while Engineering’s building the product. Product, Design, and Engineering will work together to address these needs and questions that arise while working on the product. ^ref-51567

## Highlight

In the product marketing phase of the product-development life cycle, you figure out how to succinctly and effectively communicate how the product solves that problem and makes the customer awesome. It’s essentially storytelling, and we call it “messaging.” ^ref-2660

## Highlight

As a product manager, keeping the company’s core value proposition in mind will help you understand the company’s vision. Understanding the vision will let you understand the company’s goals, which lets you understand its product roadmap. We’re getting ahead of ourselves here! Suffice it to say, your first task when looking at a company from a product point of view needs to be understanding its “why.” ^ref-26367

A common question PMs deal with is, how do we pick the right goals and supporting success metrics to focus on? In general, it depends on your company. But Sarah Tavel, who was Pinterest’s founding PM for search and discovery and is now a partner at Greylock, noticed a trend in the success metrics of successful consumer-focused internet startups, and she wrote up her findings in a blog post entitled “The Hierarchy of Engagement.” Tavel noted that there are three distinct strategy phases startups, and by extension new products, go through: engagement, retention, and self-perpetuating. Startups that go through all three tend to turn into multibillion-dollar companies, whereas startups that get stuck in one phase commonly fail. ^ref-44708

## Highlight

Vanity metrics are those that sound useful, and might be great for some other business need, but don’t help us measure product performance. Actionable metrics are real data we can use to make decisions. ^ref-42226

## Highlight

NPS is measured by asking customers, “On a scale of 1–10, how likely is it that you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague?” Promoters rank your brand 9 or 10 and are “loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth.” These are the people you want! Passives will rank you 7 or 8 and are “satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.” Detractors score you from 0 to 6 and “are unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.” ^ref-31931
- Location: [793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071HFBGXR&location=793)

### Note
I've analyzed this type of feedback in previous roles. 

Over time, this type of data can be really useful. However, as customers accounts grow, this can get difficult to measure, with so many customers having different needs and expectations. Some customers may use the survey to voice unrelated concerns, which may skew the results. 

Therefore, using NPS method should be well monitored and worded to encourage customers to guide them in providing well-thought-out, actionable feedback that can help shape a product.

---
## Highlight

Measuring NPS over time is a way to see how customers are reacting to the product changes you make (or don’t make). If your company’s goal is customer satisfaction, with NPS as your success metric, and your NPS is lower than you’d like, then your immediate product goals will be around improving your customers’ happiness. ^ref-7857
- Location: [801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071HFBGXR&location=801)

### Note
Feedback is vital in documentation. We need to know what isn't working well so that we can improve. The tricky part is, when people find issues, they tend to not report them for a variety of reasons, with the main one being they don't know where or how to report the issue. Instead, they drop off from the product and you lose someone who could have been a promoter.

## Highlight

The key definition of an iterative change is that you’re taking an existing product and making it better. Iteration is incredibly important, as the first version of a product is never perfect for all customers, and it’s through iteration that a product evolves to become something customers love. If you don’t have product/market fit yet, we’d recommend focusing on achieving it before trying to focus on revenue or growth goals. What is also nice about iteration is that you already have information about how the customers are using the product, and your hypothesis about what to do next might come from quantitative sources (like how many users complain about a bug), or qualitative sources (like ideas the support team has). ^ref-2908

---
## Highlight

The downside to iteration is that you can get stuck finding the “local maxima.” This means that you’ve optimized something really well, but you focused so much on optimization that you missed a bigger shift that happened. ^ref-5894

## Highlight

Identify the key success metric supporting your goal and the metrics that support that goal. If your success metric is how engaged your customers are, you should track how often they complete the core “success” action and the steps that lead to it. If the right metrics aren’t there, then your first task for this iteration of the product-development life cycle is to implement analytics for those metrics. ^ref-10207
- Location: [1115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071HFBGXR&location=1115)

---
## Highlight

Nearly any sequentialaction group of metrics (workflow) can form a funnel, and your goal is always to look at how a user goes from initiating to completing an action. Not every customer enters your product the same way (e.g., tapping an app on the home screen to open it the first time, opening the app for the tenth time with a restored state, tapping a link that opens the app, etc.). Your analytics tool likely has a behavior flow report to see how users enter the funnel and where they go. Any place there’s a substantial undesired falloff is a potential opportunity, and you should flag that particular metric. ^ref-46652

## Highlight

In a feature audit, you start by creating a graph of how many people use a feature on the x-axis vs. how often they use it (See Table 3-1). When doing this, make sure to exclude “administrative” features such as password recovery, as they’ll skew the result. The core value of your product, the reason it exists and people buy it, should be at the top right (Feature C) because everyone should use it all the time. Table 3-1. A sample Intercom feature audit table. ^ref-1268

Seen in Figure 3-2, the Hook Canvas has four elements. First is the trigger—what happens to get the user to the product? Second—what’s the absolute simplest thing you can get a customer to do that will give them the reward? Third—what reward can you provide that’s fulfilling and makes the user want more and invest in the product? Last, what tiny bit of action can you get the customer to invest in doing that will lead to more triggers and get them to return? Figure 3-2. Nir Eyal’s Hook Canvas and its four phases. ^ref-63410

As a PM, you’re in a unique position to know what the major pain points for customers are, how they’re reacting to your product, what the technical issues are with your product, and what technical innovations have occurred within your engineering team. ^ref-12783

Stravinsky, Faulkner, Picasso…regardless of who said it, you might have heard the quote, “Good artists copy. Great artists steal.” Sometimes your competition has a great idea, and stealing it—and making it better—is your opportunity. Be careful with this source. “Because the other guy did it” is never a valid reason alone to create a feature—that’s just copying. ^ref-44354

A SWOT analysis is a common method for looking at how an opportunity hypothesis fits in. SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This framework helps you identify the most important internal and external elements of achieving your goals. ^ref-8852

---
## Highlight

To do a SWOT analysis, first identify your key goals and success metrics. Then create a two-by-two table like Table 4-1. The top row will be your internal elements—the strengths and weaknesses for the product/ company around achieving your goals. The bottom row will look at external elements—the opportunities and threats, including things like cultural, governmental, and technological trends. ^ref-5913

## Highlight

Here’s a checklist of questions that will help you start validating an opportunity. If the answer to any of these is negative, then you should most likely not pursue this opportunity. Is this opportunity in line with our vision? Does it support the product’s vision and core function? Can we do it well with our capabilities (or is it feasible and desirable to expand our capabilities to meet the opportunity)? How does it contribute to our key metrics? Do we have any data, be it from analytics, surveys, or bug reports, to support this opportunity? Is it required to meet a critical business initiative? How does it contribute to our users’ winning? Is it on our roadmap for this year, even indirectly as part of something else? Will it matter in two years? (It’s OK if the feature is to address an immediate need, but you’ll want to limit those, as you want to prioritize things that have a higher value over time.) Will everyone benefit? If it only helps a niche set of customers, is it worth the cost? If it succeeds, can we support it? ^ref-47085

## Highlight

So what is customer development? It’s a way to validate if the people you think are your customers truly are the right customers and confirming you’re on the right path. This includes finding out what problems customers are seeking to solve, what they’re doing right now that either creates those problems and tries to solve them, what they’re able to do (technically, financially, socially, etc.), and how they find out about and decide if a new product/feature is worth it. Fundamentally, it’s a conversation and an exchange of information. It’s also useful to know what customer development is not. It’s not a way for people to give you a wish list. It’s not a focus group to only see how people respond to ideas. It’s not a place to observe how customers use your prototype. It’s also not a replacement for product vision. Customers will give you a huge wish list, but they’ll often ask for more than they actually need, end up not using features, and —in really bad cases—might get confused by all the extra features. This is a big part of why we recommend having some opportunity hypotheses in mind first. ^ref-47639
