## Highlight

Put simply, a product manager (PM) represents the customer. No one buys a product because they want to give the company money. Customers buy and use products because the products address their needs. Done properly, the products let the customers be awesome. The end result of representing the customer is that a PM helps the customer be awesome. ^ref-55428

## Highlight

Day to day, PMs must understand both business strategy and execution. They must first figure out who the customers are and what problems the customers have. They must know how to set a vision, finding the right opportunities in a sea of possibilities, by using both data and intuition. They must know how to define success, for the customer and the product, by prioritizing doing what is right over doing what is easy. ^ref-15506

## Highlight

PMs manage products, not people, so they must achieve everything using soft influence, effective communication, leadership, and trust—not orders. ^ref-54322

Project managers are masters of schedules and Gantt charts, not of representing customers. ^ref-57604

## Highlight

Program managers tend to be masters of execution, sort of like a “super” project manager. ^ref-11554

## Highlight

Product managers are like the conductor in an orchestra. The conductor never makes a sound but is responsible for making the orchestra as a whole sound awesome to deliver a great performance to the audience. Great conductors understand and engage with everyone in the orchestra, using the right vocabulary with each section, diplomatically moving everyone together toward the shared goal of a great performance. ^ref-38212

## Highlight

The most common approach you’ll encounter is a hybrid of waterfall and lean where the PM will plan a bit upfront to find the right opportunity, but then the teams will implement the product in an iterative way. This is nice because it lets you keep a big-picture goal in mind, but change course if needed such as if you find a significant technical obstacle or find that customers don’t want the product you’re building. We’ll mainly focus on a hybrid approach in this book. ^ref-40729

## Highlight

Every product goes through five key conceptual stages: 1. Finding and planning the right opportunity 2. Designing the solution 3. Building the solution 4. Sharing the solution 5. Assessing the solution Put another way, this process involves figuring out what problem to work on, figuring out how to solve it, building the solution, getting it in customers’ hands, and seeing if it worked for them. ^ref-23718

## Highlight

The very first phase of the product-development life cycle is to find and clearly define the next opportunity to pursue. The world’s a sea of possibilities! What should you build next? Usually, it’s up to the product manager to create and sort through all the possibilities, picking the right one to focus on next. ^ref-24636

## Highlight

At a high level, company goals fall into three categories: growth, revenue, and customer satisfaction. Specifically, does the company want to get more users for the product, increase its revenue from the current customers, or make its current customers happier? If the goal is revenue, how does the company currently monetize their product, and how can you increase the value for customers to make them more willing to pay for the product? If the goal is growth, what’s stopping new customers from using the product? If the goal is to delight their customers, what can you deliver that they would love, but wouldn’t expect? By understanding the current goals you can think strategically, and make sure the products you’re building align with those goals, helping the company be successful. ^ref-28939

Scoping means clearly defining the opportunity and the customers you want to target, along with the requirements for the solution. ^ref-62545

## Highlight

Most companies using a hybrid model never build a true MVP, but rather an MVP with some extra key features they believe will make the product more enticing. If you know for certain customers will want those key features, incorporating them from the start will help shorten the iteration cycle. ^ref-33775

## Highlight

Product managers create a document that encompasses the entire planning phase, called a product requirements document (PRD), collecting all this planning information in one spot. A PRD contains the explanation for why you’re pursuing this opportunity, the scoped problem definition, the success metrics, and more. But you don’t create the PRD in isolation—you’ll work with your team, your boss, and other product stakeholders to make sure the opportunity and requirements are clear and the goals are achievable. ^ref-2122

---
## Highlight

In the hybrid model, the PRD is treated as a great communications tool to get everyone on the same page and as a living—not dictating—document. Over the product-development life cycle, the PRD will expand to contain more information, but it starts by clearly stating the problem and why we’re working on it. When the product’s built, the PRD provides a great reference for the sales and support teams to understand what’s in the product and why. ^ref-40696

## Highlight

Contrary to popular belief, design doesn’t just mean what the solution looks like. Design involves aspects like information architecture (In what order are things presented to the user?), wireframes (Where should the information live on the screen?), and pixels (How does it look?). ^ref-44881

## Highlight

Engineers hate taking on technical debt—they want to write a complete answer from the outset. If you come from an engineering background, taking on technical debt can be hard. As a PM, you’ll often have to make hard tradeoff decisions, accepting short-term debt to provide customer value faster. The opposite is true as well, which is hard for PMs from a non-technical background. You’ll have to pay off that debt later—cleaning up the code—otherwise the code can get unwieldy, and it can become very hard to iterate on the project. ^ref-26689

## Highlight

while Design will have figured out the most common use cases in the prototyping stage, there are likely many edge cases that will come up while Engineering’s building the product. Product, Design, and Engineering will work together to address these needs and questions that arise while working on the product. ^ref-51567

## Highlight

In the product marketing phase of the product-development life cycle, you figure out how to succinctly and effectively communicate how the product solves that problem and makes the customer awesome. It’s essentially storytelling, and we call it “messaging.” ^ref-2660

## Highlight

As a product manager, keeping the company’s core value proposition in mind will help you understand the company’s vision. Understanding the vision will let you understand the company’s goals, which lets you understand its product roadmap. We’re getting ahead of ourselves here! Suffice it to say, your first task when looking at a company from a product point of view needs to be understanding its “why.” ^ref-26367

A common question PMs deal with is, how do we pick the right goals and supporting success metrics to focus on? In general, it depends on your company. But Sarah Tavel, who was Pinterest’s founding PM for search and discovery and is now a partner at Greylock, noticed a trend in the success metrics of successful consumer-focused internet startups, and she wrote up her findings in a blog post entitled “The Hierarchy of Engagement.” Tavel noted that there are three distinct strategy phases startups, and by extension new products, go through: engagement, retention, and self-perpetuating. Startups that go through all three tend to turn into multibillion-dollar companies, whereas startups that get stuck in one phase commonly fail. ^ref-44708

## Highlight

Vanity metrics are those that sound useful, and might be great for some other business need, but don’t help us measure product performance. Actionable metrics are real data we can use to make decisions. ^ref-42226
