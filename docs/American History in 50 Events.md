## Highlight

Of particular concern to the colony of Boston was the taxation of essential goods—paper, wax, sugar, and others—but the increased taxation of tea was the most egregious of all. The Sons of Liberty decided to stage a physical protest of the new tax, and on December 16, 1773, a group of these men, disguised as Native Americans, boarded the British cargo ships and dumped the tea chests into Boston Harbor. The protest became known as the Boston Tea Party. This demonstration set in motion the events that would ultimately lead to the American Revolution. ^ref-12133

## Highlight

On July 4, 1776, the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, a document which formally severed ties between Britain and the colonies. From the British point of view, this was an act of treason and served only to further their desire to reassert control. For many Americans (as they had begun to think of themselves), this document solidified something they already knew—their subjection to British law was over. As it was considered a document of treason, many members of the Congress were hesitant to sign, until President of the Congress, John Hancock, signed his name in such a large script that his signature would draw the most attention and hopefully, draw most of the king’s rage. This move inspired others to sign. After the official adoption of the Declaration, copies were quickly delivered to the colonies so that all Americans could be made aware of the events that had transpired. The Declaration of Independence became one of the foundational and pivotal documents of American government. ^ref-4108

## Highlight

Washington remains the only president who were not a member of an American political party, as he believed them to be divisive and harmful to the common good. ^ref-60938

## Highlight

Despite the contributions of African Americans to World War II and the Korean War, the racial gap in America had widened during the 1950s to the point that African Americans were not allowed to use the same drinking fountains, attend the same schools, or sit in preferential seats on public transportation. ^ref-38961

### Note
I don't think saying "the racial gap widened" is accurate. I think the racial gap just became more apparent because of African Americans being involved more with society.

## Highlight

However, starting in 1955, a conflict in Vietnam would eventually drag America into war once again. ^ref-58539

### Note
As more recent documentation shows, America seems to have involved itself in Vietnam. America was not dragged into conflict.

## Highlight

This distrust of government shaped the attitudes of many Americans in the 1970s and 1980s, and this was felt particularly strongly in music, where the theme of rebellion was championed. ^ref-62517

### Note
Arguably, this is when some of the best music was created.
