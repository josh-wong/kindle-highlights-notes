## Highlight

The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view. ^ref-6643

## Highlight

It becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum change, we need to work on our basic paradigms. ^ref-64041

## Highlight

Albert Einstein observed, “The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.” ^ref-61843

---
## Highlight

Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three. ^ref-56398

- Location: [646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=646)

## Highlight

But much of our current emphasis on independence is a reaction to dependence—to having others control us, define us, use us, and manipulate us. ^ref-36142

- Location: [689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=689)

---
## Highlight

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. If we don’t continually invest in improving our own PC, we severely limit our options. We’re locked into our present situation, running scared of our corporation or our boss’s opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive. Again, it simply isn’t effective. ^ref-61436

---
## Highlight

When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden eggs, the benefits, than they are in preserving the relationship that makes them possible, they often become insensitive and inconsiderate, neglecting the little kindnesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship. They begin to use control levers to manipulate each other, to focus on their own needs, to justify their own position and look for evidence to show the wrongness of the other person. The love, the richness, the softness and spontaneity begin to deteriorate. The goose gets sicker day by day. ^ref-24425

- Location: [764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=764)

---
## Highlight

There are organizations that talk a lot about the customer and then completely neglect the people that deal with the customer—the employees. The PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers. ^ref-59864

- Location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=819)

### Note
Agree. Treating your employees like you do your customers has a ripple effect not only throughout the organization but also externally--for example, when attracting talent or new customers.

## Highlight

We are not our feelings. We are not our moods. We are not even our thoughts. ^ref-6473

---
## Highlight

Self-awareness enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we “see” ourselves—our self-paradigm, the most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviors, but also how we see other people. It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. ^ref-44769

- Location: [911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=911)

---
## Highlight

If the only vision we have of ourselves comes from the social mirror—from the current social paradigm and from the opinions, perceptions, and paradigms of the people around us—our view of ourselves is like the reflection in the crazy mirror room at the carnival. ^ref-43947

- Location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=919)

---
## Highlight

Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling. ^ref-54160

- Location: [985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=985)

---
## Highlight

Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and their performance. ^ref-53706

- Location: [990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=990)

---
## Highlight

Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the “social weather.” When people treat them well, they feel well; when people don’t, they become defensive or protective. Reactive people build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of other people to control them. ^ref-26995

- Location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=993)

---
## Highlight

Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. ^ref-47250

- Location: [996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=996)

---
## Highlight

It’s not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. ^ref-6067

- Location: [1020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1020)

---
## Highlight

what matters most is how we respond to what we experience in life. ^ref-8016

- Location: [1048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1048)

---
## Highlight

Our basic nature is to act, and not be acted upon. As well as enabling us to choose our response to particular circumstances, this empowers us to create circumstances. Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, obnoxious, or aggressive. It does mean recognizing our responsibility to make things happen. ^ref-16395

- Location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1052)

---
## Highlight

A serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People become reinforced in the paradigm that they are determined, and they produce evidence to support the belief. They feel increasingly victimized and out of control, not in charge of their life or their destiny. They blame outside forces—other people, circumstances, even the stars—for their own situation. ^ref-50219

- Location: [1130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1130)

---
## Highlight

Management is a bottom line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals with the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish? In the words of both Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis, “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.” Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall. ^ref-8165

- Location: [1443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1443)

---
## Highlight

Efficient management without effective leadership is, as one individual has phrased it, “like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic.” No management success can compensate for failure in leadership. But leadership is hard because we’re often caught in a management paradigm. ^ref-21830

- Location: [1465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1465)

---
## Highlight

If our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from our marriage, then we become highly dependent upon that relationship. We become vulnerable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and treatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the relationship—a new child, in-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth. ^ref-62368

- Location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1636)

---
## Highlight

As proactive people, we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives. We can write a personal mission statement, a personal constitution. A mission statement is not something you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites to produce it in final form. It may take you several weeks or even months before you feel really comfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete and concise expression of your innermost values and directions. Even then, you will want to review it regularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. ^ref-48937

- Location: [1879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1879)

---
## Highlight

Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes you because it forces you to think through your priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior with your beliefs. As you do, other people begin to sense that you’re not being driven by everything that happens to you. You have a sense of mission about what you’re trying to do and you are excited about it. ^ref-40693

- Location: [1888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=1888)

---
## Highlight

Effective management is putting first things first. While leadership decides what “first things” are, it is management that puts them first, day-by-day, moment-by-moment. Management is discipline, carrying it out. ^ref-53031

- Location: [2214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2214)

---
## Highlight

“The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don’t like to do,” he observed. “They don’t like doing them either necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose.” ^ref-1455

- Location: [2223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2223)

---
## Highlight

Urgent matters are usually visible. They press on us; they insist on action. They’re often popular with others. They’re usually right in front of us. And often they are pleasant, easy, fun to do. But so often they are unimportant! Importance, on the other hand, has to do with results. If something is important, it contributes to your mission, your values, your high priority goals. ^ref-17164

- Location: [2264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2264)

---
## Highlight

Some people are literally beaten up by problems all day every day. The only relief they have is in escaping to the not important, not urgent activities of Quadrant IV. So when you look at their total matrix, 90 percent of their time is in Quadrant I and most of the remaining 10 percent is in Quadrant IV, with only negligible attention paid to Quadrants II and III. That’s how people who manage their lives by crisis live. ^ref-61774

- Location: [2276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2276)

### Note
I definitely feel like this when I'm experiencing burnout and feeling down and need a "quick win" for the sake of morale. However, those "quick wins" come at the expense of the bigger picture of important tasks, as described in Quadrant II.

---
## Highlight

Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal management. It deals with things that are not urgent, but are important. It deals with things like building relationships, writing a personal mission statement, long-range planning, exercising, preventive maintenance, preparation—all those things we know we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren’t urgent. ^ref-48863

- Location: [2286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2286)

---
## Highlight

We accomplish all that we do through delegation—either to time or to other people. If we delegate to time, we think efficiency. If we delegate to other people, we think effectiveness. Many people refuse to delegate to other people because they feel it takes too much time and effort and they could do the job better themselves. But effectively delegating to others is perhaps the single most powerful high-leverage activity there is. Transferring responsibility to other skilled and trained people enables you to give your energies to other high-leverage activities. Delegation means growth, both for individuals and for organizations. ^ref-54379

- Location: [2552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2552)

---
## Highlight

If you know the failure paths of the job, identify them. Be honest and open—tell a person where the quicksand is and where the wild animals are. You don’t want to have to reinvent the wheel every day. Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others. Point out the potential failure paths, what not to do, but don’t tell them what to do. Keep the responsibility for results with them—to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines. ^ref-22631

## Highlight

An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor that describes the amount of trust that’s been built up in a relationship. It’s the feeling of safeness you have with another human being. If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank Account with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, and keeping my commitments to you, I build up a reserve. Your trust toward me becomes higher, and I can call upon that trust many times if I need to. I can even make mistakes and that trust level, that emotional reserve, will compensate for it. My communication may not be clear, but you’ll get my meaning anyway. You won’t make me “an offender for a word.” When the trust account is high, communication is easy, instant, and effective. But if I have a habit of showing discourtesy, disrespect, cutting you off, overreacting, ignoring you, becoming arbitrary, betraying your trust, threatening you, or playing little tin god in your life, eventually my Emotional Bank Account is overdrawn. The trust level gets very low. Then what flexibility do I have? None. ^ref-48669

## Highlight

One of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those who are not present. In doing so, we build the trust of those who are present. When you defend those who are absent, you retain the trust of those present. ^ref-47808

- Location: [2925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2925)

---
## Highlight

Integrity in an interdependent reality is simply this: you treat everyone by the same set of principles. As you do, people will come to trust you. They may not at first appreciate the honest confrontational experiences such integrity might generate. Confrontation takes considerable courage, and many people would prefer to take the course of least resistance, belittling and criticizing, betraying confidences, or participating in gossip about others behind their backs. But in the long run, people will trust and respect you if you are honest and open and kind with them. You care enough to confront. And to be trusted, it is said, is greater than to be loved. In the long run, I am convinced, to be trusted will be also to be loved. ^ref-50884

- Location: [2940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2940)

---
## Highlight

When we make withdrawals from the Emotional Bank Account, we need to apologize and we need to do it sincerely. Great deposits come in the sincere words: “I was wrong.” “That was unkind of me.” “I showed you no respect.” “I gave you no dignity, and I’m deeply sorry.” “I embarrassed you in front of your friends and I had no call to do that. Even though I wanted to make a point, I never should have done it. I apologize.” ^ref-20168

- Location: [2955](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2955)

---
## Highlight

When we violate the primary laws of love—when we attach strings and conditions to that gift—we actually encourage others to violate the primary laws of life. We put them in a reactive, defensive position where they feel they have to prove “I matter as a person, independent of you.” ^ref-22425

- Location: [2992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=2992)

---
## Highlight

Out of the 800 people there, around forty received awards for top performance, such as “Most Sales,” “Greatest Volume,” “Highest Earned Commissions,” and “Most Listings.” There was a lot of hoopla—excitement, cheering, applause—around the presentation of these awards. There was no doubt that those forty people had won; but there was also the underlying awareness that 760 people had lost. ^ref-19045

- Location: [3523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=3523)

---
## Highlight

So often the problem is in the system, not in the people. If you put good people in bad systems, you get bad results. You have to water the flowers you want to grow. ^ref-26006

---
## Highlight

Win/Win is not a personality technique. It’s a total paradigm of human interaction. It comes from a character of integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality. It grows out of high-trust relationships. It is embodied in agreements that effectively clarify and manage expectations as well as accomplishment. It thrives in supportive systems. ^ref-35979

- Location: [3600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=3600)

---
## Highlight

This is one of the greatest insights in the field of human motivation: Satisfied needs do not motivate. It’s only the unsatisfied need that motivates. Next to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival—to be understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated. ^ref-5285

- Location: [3721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=3721)

## Highlight

An effective sales person first seeks to understand the needs, the concerns, the situation of the customer. The amateur salesman sells products; the professional sells solutions to needs and problems. ^ref-61449

- Location: [3777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=3777)

---
## Highlight

The person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction with the hearts and minds of other human beings. That person values the differences because those differences add to his knowledge, to his understanding of reality. When we’re left to our own experiences, we constantly suffer from a shortage of data. ^ref-62372

## Highlight

The relationship of the parts is also the power in creating a synergistic culture inside a family or an organization. The more genuine the involvement, the more sincere and sustained the participation in analyzing and solving problems, the greater the release of everyone’s creativity, and of their commitment to what they create. ^ref-61116

## Highlight

This, I’m convinced, is the essence of the power in the Japanese approach to business, which has changed the world marketplace. ^ref-48880

- Location: [4482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=4482)

### Note
The author should have expanded on this. Internally, traditional Japanese companies tend to lack honest synergy amongst employees for the sake of harmonic synergy. "The nail that sticks up gets hammered down."

Now if we're talking about how separate companies work with each other, I can agree with this. Companies, especially consumer-facing businesses, seem much more likely to work together to create win-win situations.

## Highlight

Continuing surveys indicate that television is on in most homes some thirty-five to forty-five hours a week. That’s as much time as many people put into their jobs, more than most put into school. It’s the most powerful socializing influence there is. And when we watch, we’re subject to all the values that are being taught through it. That can powerfully influence us in very subtle and imperceptible ways. ^ref-52697

- Location: [4648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=4648)

### Note
Since the mid-2010s, one could argue that smartphones and social media have replaced this TV time.

This process of continuous improvement is the hallmark of the Total Quality Movement and a key to Japan’s economic ascendency. ^ref-39697

- Location: [4801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=4801)

### Note
Although Japan is still considered a large player in the global economy in 2022, I don't think this statement holds true anymore like it did when this book was first published in 1989.
