## Highlight

THE FUTURE OF WORK ROBOTS, AI, AND AUTOMATION ^ref-32147
- Location: [4](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0741CP8N5&location=4)

### Note
The last few chapters of this book hardly discuss robots, AI, and automation. Instead, the content focuses on economy and politics, without really discussing what role AI and automation plays into those topics.

## Highlight

The difficulty in many of these cases is that AI operates by linking computing decisions to a baseline of existing data. Such a decisionmaking method can be problematic because historical data sets often reflect traditional values, which may or may not represent the values or preferences wanted in a current system. ^ref-34425

## Highlight

A survey of AI experts by researchers at Yale University and Oxford University found that technical specialists believe a dramatic workforce transformation will take place over the next few decades. ^ref-31964

## Highlight

With clear health and economic benefits resulting from paid leave, the researchers convincingly argue it is time for America to end its status as the only developed nation not to provide paid leave for family care. ^ref-38960

### Note
Ideally, this would happen at the federal or even state level. Fortunately, there seem to be companies that take this social responsibility into their own hands.

## Highlight

The 401(k) saving program was originally designed in 1978 as a supplement to existing pension programs. But in many cases it has now replaced the traditional pension. In 1979, 38 percent of American private sector workers had a traditional pension, but that number has dropped to 13 percent of workers in 2017. Rather than rely on a benefit-defined alternative, the 401(k) plan has become a common vehicle for retirement saving. However, only 55 percent of Americans currently have a retirement account, and the average person has only around $50,000 in overall retirement savings. This is far below what will be needed for actual retirement. According to Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research, 52 percent of households are likely to run low on money during old age. ^ref-25146

## Highlight

Finding a way to aid those individuals should be a high priority in the digital economy. ^ref-20056
- Location: [1776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0741CP8N5&location=1776)

### Note
Although I think this is important, I wish the author had gone into detail, at this point, about how we could possibly remedy this.

## Highlight

Ben Schiller has written that “a universal basic income is the bipartisan solution to poverty we’ve been waiting for.” ^ref-29217
- Location: [1782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0741CP8N5&location=1782)

### Note
I don't agree with this. A basic universal income will let some people continue to be lazy and live at the poverty level (or "new poverty level"). We need innovation to create better jobs for people, not another welfare system that essentially forces taxes on people making more than the universal basic income.

## Highlight

Proponents see a basic income as a way to provide people with greater flexibility in social welfare support. ^ref-21104
- Location: [1796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0741CP8N5&location=1796)

### Note
Glad to see the author tackle this concern. However, there are many more concerns outside of this that need to be discussed in detail.

## Highlight

If there were no exclusions for charitable contributions or other considerations, a 1 percent wealth tax would generate about $379 billion in government revenue each year. ^ref-6460
- Location: [1915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0741CP8N5&location=1915)

### Note
This is pretty substantial, but would rely on those who fall in that income to not have tax havens.

## Highlight

The emerging economy presents challenges in terms of ensuring workers’ income and social benefits. As employers move away from full-time jobs with benefits to temporary positions without benefits, it is vital that we figure out ways to support essential services. Emerging technologies allow businesses to provide goods and services with far fewer employees, so it is crucial to develop new models of benefit delivery. ^ref-43499
- Location: [1948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0741CP8N5&location=1948)

### Note
I agree with this statement. Ensuring people can provide for themselves and making sure families can thrive, not just "get by," is vital for our society.
