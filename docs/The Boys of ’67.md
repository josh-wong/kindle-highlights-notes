## Highlight

All the Vietnamese prostitutes come down to the fox holes at night to peddle their wares! Only about ½ the guys will touch them and there are a few who have already paid the price. One guy I know came in to see the doctor and found out he had 4 different types of V.D.! 4 The docs told him it would be impossible to cure him because they’ve never seen anything like the 4 types he’s got. Incurable. They’re going to send him back to the states to see if anything can be done there, but they doubt it. He’s a very unhappy and sorrowful boy right now. It sounds kind of funny, but if they can’t cure all 4, he signed his death warrant. ^ref-43863

## Highlight

The pressure cooker of war, along with the growing bonds of camaraderie within Charlie Company, blurred differences of race and class that had once seemed so important. ^ref-4355
