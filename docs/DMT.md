Or as Dogen, a thirteenth-century Japanese Buddhist teacher, said, “We must always be disturbed by the truth.” ^ref-63652

## Highlight

Enthusiasts of the psychedelic drug culture may dislike my conclusion: that DMT has no beneficial effects in and of itself; that rather, the context in which people take it is at least as important. ^ref-5083

## Highlight

Ronald Siegel and Terence McKenna, for example, suggest that our apelike ancestors imitated other animals by eating things that caused unusual behavior. In this way, they discovered the earliest mind-altering substances. ^ref-4423

## Highlight

Some authors have proposed that language developed out of psychedelically enhanced appreciation of, and associations with, early hominid mouth sounds. Others suggest that psychedelic states formed the basis of humans’ earliest awareness of religious experience. ^ref-26777

## Highlight

In addition, Freud distrusted religion and believed spiritual or religious experience was a defense against childish fears and wishes. ^ref-61793

## Highlight

While there was little effect on the underlying medical conditions, psychedelic psychotherapy in these patients had striking psychological effects. Depression lifted, requirements for pain medication fell dramatically, and patients’ acceptance of their disease and its prognosis improved markedly. ^ref-35650

## Highlight

Psychedelics exert their effects by a complex blending of three factors: set, setting, and drug. ^ref-21068

---
## Highlight

Hallucinogen is the most common medical term for psychedelic drugs, and it emphasizes the perceptual, mostly visual effects of these drugs. However, while perceptual effects of psychedelics are usual, they are not the only effects, nor are they necessarily the most valued. The visions actually may be distractions from the more sought-after properties of the experience, such as intense euphoria, profound intellectual or spiritual insights, and the dissolving of the body’s physical boundaries. ^ref-809

## Highlight

The best-known phenethylamine is mescaline, which is derived from the peyote cactus of the American Southwest. ^ref-31296

---
## Highlight

This is as good an example of the power of a negative set and setting as there is: two people high on injected DMT in a seedy flat at the same time, one being responsible for the other. “Terror” drug, indeed. ^ref-60848

## Highlight

Some bold individuals thought it possible to take DMT during lunch, and so it gained the dubious nickname, “businessman’s trip.” ^ref-18282

---
## Highlight

The pineal gland of evolutionarily older animals, such as lizards and amphibians, is also called the “third” eye. Just like the two seeing eyes, the third eye possesses a lens, cornea, and retina. It is light-sensitive and helps regulate body temperature and skin coloration—two basic survival functions intimately related to environmental light. ^ref-29822

---
## Highlight

The human pineal gland becomes visible in the developing fetus at seven weeks, or forty-nine days, after conception. Of great interest to me was finding out that this is nearly exactly the moment in which one can clearly see the first indication of male or female gender. Before this time, the sex of the fetus is indeterminate, or unknown. Thus, the pineal gland and the most important differentiation of humanity, male and female gender, appear at the same time. ^ref-11093

---
## Highlight

The human pineal gland is not actually part of the brain. Rather, it develops from specialized tissues in the roof of the fetal mouth. From there it migrates to the center of the brain, where it seems to have the best seat in the house. ^ref-18536

## Highlight

They found that constant darkness blocked reproductive function and shrank the sexual organs; it also stimulated pineal growth and the production of melatonin. On the other hand, constant light shrank the pineal, reduced melatonin levels, and turned on sexual function. Using these experimental results, scientists concluded that melatonin was the crucial pineal factor in whose presence reproductive function flagged, and in whose absence reproductive function flourished. Put simply, melatonin possessed powerful anti-reproductive effects. ^ref-30343

## Highlight

The longer the nighttime dark hours, the more melatonin. The greater the daylight hours, the less melatonin. ^ref-27373

- Location: [1215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003N3U3J4&location=1215)

---
## Highlight

Some early studies suggested that melatonin has mind-altering properties. For example, administering high doses before bedtime seemed to induce vivid dreams. ^ref-30756

## Highlight

The most general hypothesis is that the pineal gland produces psychedelic amounts of DMT at extraordinary times in our lives. ^ref-37154

---
## Highlight

One of the most striking examples of how beta-carbolines work is ayahuasca. Certain plants that contain betacarbolines are combined with other plants that contain DMT to make this psychedelic Amazonian brew, which allows the DMT to become orally active. If it weren’t for the beta-carbolines, MAO in the gut would rapidly destroy this swallowed DMT, and it would have no effect on our minds. ^ref-7135

- Location: [1322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003N3U3J4&location=1322)

## Highlight

The most likely time for us to dream is also the time at which melatonin levels are highest, that is, around 3 A.M. ^ref-8676

- Location: [1391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003N3U3J4&location=1391)

## Highlight

That is, the body so ruthlessly defends the pineal gland so that we are not disabled by everyday levels of stress releasing psychedelic levels of DMT. ^ref-38763

## Highlight

That is, seven weeks from the time of death of one person elapses until the life-force’s “rebirth” into its next body. ^ref-36108

---
## Highlight

It takes forty-nine days from conception for the first signs of the human pineal to appear. Forty-nine days is also when the fetus differentiates into male or female gender. Thus the soul’s rebirth, the pineal, and the sexual organs all require forty-nine days before they manifest. ^ref-57479

## Highlight

“What do you normally do when you find yourself overwhelmed in a psychedelic experience?” “I usually breath deeply and slowly. ^ref-64295

## Highlight

Tolerance occurs when the same dose of a drug produces smaller effects when taken repeatedly. LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline all produce rapid and nearly complete tolerance after three or four daily doses. ^ref-54250

- Location: [2482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003N3U3J4&location=2482)

## Highlight

Most people found the high dose of DMT exciting, euphoric, and extraordinarily pleasurable. ^ref-55056

## Highlight

For others the fear and anxiety were nearly unbearable. ^ref-43137

- Location: [2704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003N3U3J4&location=2704)

---
## Highlight

I’ve noticed that nausea in an altered state of consciousness often is a way for the body to distract us from anxiety and sadness. ^ref-15745

## Highlight

The visual images volunteers encountered on DMT sometimes reminded them of dreams. And, as Freud said, dreams are “the royal road to the unconscious.” ^ref-55973

- Location: [2922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003N3U3J4&location=2922)

---
## Highlight

For example, the euphoria brought on by DMT helped volunteers more unflinchingly look at their lives and conflicts. ^ref-39205

## Highlight

The nature of the near-death experience is due to the psychedelic “side effects” of ketamine. ^ref-874
