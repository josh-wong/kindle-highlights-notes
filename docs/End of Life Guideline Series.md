## Highlight

The key thing to remember in keeping a person free of physical pain is to medicate until death. Keep to the pain-management schedule. A gentle death is a relaxed death and you cannot be relaxed if you are in physical pain. ^ref-55328

## Highlight

As we watch the person we care about proceed through labor it is important to remember that the labor to leave this world is usually harder on us, the watchers, than on the person who is dying. ^ref-1400

## Highlight

The key to getting out of the body is to relax. It is that easy. Tension creates a tightness that locks us in our body and makes our labor longer. Relax and we can release easily. ^ref-3441

## Highlight

With everyone gathered around the bed, take the nonresponsive, dying person’s hand and gently stroke it. You are getting the “driver’s” attention. Begin talking by stating who you are. Then, in your own manner, address these issues: ^ref-63016

## Highlight

   You are dying. This is what it is like to die.    Relax; be like a log flowing down stream, go with whatever comes or walk through a lovely garden following a path that leads to a gate that you walk through.    You are doing a good job; you have always done the best you could in life; let go of any feelings of mistakes or failures; take only the good with you.    Everyone here understands that you have to leave. We will miss you, we love you, but we understand it is time for you to go. You can leave whenever you are ready.    You are not alone; others who have died before you are here to help and guide you; there may be a spiritual presence. Ask for help and help will present itself. ^ref-64440

## Highlight

At first, we think about the person continually. Then there’s a time where we actually watch an entire TV show without thinking how much they would have enjoyed it. Then there’s an afternoon luncheon where we even laugh without feeling guilty. Time stretches and stretches. Five, ten, twenty years—a word, a picture, a memory can touch the scar and it will hurt. The intensity is still there, the scar just isn’t touched as often. ^ref-30309
