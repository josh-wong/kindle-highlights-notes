## Highlight

Data is facts, observations, and questions about something. Content can be cookies, words, documents, images, videos, or whatever you're arranging or sequencing. The difference between information, data, and content is tricky, but the important point is that the absence of content or data can be just as informing as the presence. ^ref-56658

## Highlight

To start to identify the mess you're facing, work through these questions: Users: Who are your intended users? What do you know about them? How can you get to know them better? How might they describe this mess? Stakeholders: Who are your stakeholders? What are their expectations? What are their thoughts about this mess? How might they describe it? Information: What interpretations are you dealing with? What information is being created through a lack of data or content? Current state: Are you dealing with too much information, not enough information, not the right information, or a combination of these? ^ref-59465

## Highlight

Perception is the process of considering, and interpreting something. Perception is subjective like truth is. Something that's beautiful to one person may be an eyesore to another. For example, many designers would describe the busy, colorful patterns in the carpets of Las Vegas as gaudy. People who frequent casinos often describe them as beautiful. ^ref-18062

## Highlight

We need to consider our intended users. Sometimes they're our customers or the public. Often times, they're also stakeholders, colleagues, employees, partners, superiors, or clients. These are the people who use our process. To determine who matters, ask these questions: Who's most important to get agreement from? Who's most important to serve? What words might make them defensive? What words might put them at ease? How open are they to change? How will this affect their lives? How does the current state of things look to them? Is that good or bad? ^ref-57672

## Highlight

To start with why, ask yourself: Why does this work need to be done? Why is change needed? Why do those changes matter? Why should other people care? Why hasn't this been tackled correctly? Why will this time be different? ^ref-3526

## Highlight

The words we choose change the things we make and how we think about them. Our words also change how other people make sense of our work. ^ref-58565

### Note
Important to keep in mind that this applies not only to professional, business-related content but also professional and personal communication across mediums (social media, private messaging, face-to-face, etc.).

As you go through the mess, you'll encounter several types of players: Current users: People who interact with whatever you're making. Potential users: People you hope to reach. Stakeholders: People who care about the outcome of what you're making. Competitors: People who share your current or potential users. Distractors: People that could take attention away from your intent. ^ref-18386

### Note
I'd add "Advocates" to this list since they can play a big role in the success and improvement of a product and even company.

Everything is easier with a map. Let me guide you through making a map for your own mess. On the following page is another favorite diagram of mine, the matrix diagram. The power of a matrix diagram is that you can make the boxes collect whatever you want. Each box becomes a task to fulfill or a question to answer, whether you're alone or in a group. Matrix diagrams are especially useful when you're facilitating a discussion, because they're easy to create and they keep themselves on track. An empty box means you're not done yet. ^ref-25246

## Highlight

People often get in their own way by becoming overwhelmed with choices, choosing not to choose instead. Others are limited by frustration over things they can't change immediately or easily. Change takes time. Start by choosing a direction to go toward. If you take one step in that direction each day, you'll get to the finish line in due time. If you spend all your time thinking about how far the finish line is and fearing never getting there, you'll make slower progress or never make it at all. ^ref-5691

### Note
Very true. I think many of us can imagine what a successful project looks like, but getting to that point and being satisfied with the outcome is often not so straightforward or without its challenges. 

Instead of being discouraged about processes or lack of progress, notice the little wins. Focusing on small achievements while striving to meet the main objective or ideal scenario will keep you motivated.

A good controlled vocabulary considers: Variant spellings (e.g., American or British) Tone (e.g., Submit or Send) Scientific and popular terms (e.g., cockroaches or Periplaneta Americana) Insider and outsider terms (e.g., what we say at work; what we say in public) Acceptable synonyms (e.g., automobile, car, auto, or vehicle) Acceptable acronyms (e.g., General Electric, GE, or G.E.) ^ref-62445

### Note
Good things to note in a writing style guide.

## Highlight

A goal is something specific that you want to do. A well-defined goal has the following elements: Intent: What are the specific results you want to see for your efforts? Baseline: What points of reference can you use to compare your progress with where you are today? Progress: How will you measure movement towards or away from your goal? ^ref-30783

No matter what the mess is made of, we have many masters, versions of reality, and needs to serve. Information is full of history and preconceptions. ^ref-63894
