## Highlight

But what if we could really understand what someone means when he or she talks to us? Even better, what if we could predict someone's behavior based simply on what was said? Best of all-what if we could influence that behavior by how we responded? ^ref-4861

## Highlight

You pay attention to how people talk when they answer, rather than what they talk about. Even when a person does not answer the question directly, they will reveal their pattern by the manner in which they answer (or don't). ^ref-64014

## Highlight

You pay attention to how people answer, instead of what they say. In this way, after asking a few simple questions, you can determine what will trigger and maintain someone's motivation and how they internally process information. ^ref-7843

To help you identify when someone is talking about or has switched Contexts, listen for: When? Where? With whom? and a verb. When people use these cues, they are telling you what a Context is for them: ^ref-4369

Since most people at work are somewhere in the middle, they will need to think and do, respond and initiate. The best kinds of work for these people are tasks and responsibilities that allow enough of each. To motivate these people, you would use both sets of Influencing Language. For example, "I would like you to think through what needs to be done and just go do it." ^ref-32121

The authors noted that if entrepreneurs answered the Away From questions, they received much lower funding on average but if they shifted the focus to "Promotion" strategies and used goal-oriented (Toward) language, the results were very different. ^ref-1366

A great hint for all entrepreneurs looking for funding: if asked a problem-focused question by investors, start briefly with how to avoid the problem and then quickly shift to how you will achieve your goals. ^ref-16461

Gottman also found that showing contempt for a partner is the number one reason for breakups. Again, the reaction to us from our partner is an essential factor in the success of the relationship. (External) Showing kindness even when in a fight is what binds people together. (External) ^ref-15647

Why are there so many upgrades to your favorite software package? A consultant friend summed up the software problem: "Not enough time to do it right once, but all the time in the world to fix it." ^ref-17801

Creators and users of technology approach technology quite differently. Eye tracking studies[21] show that most users still use the "F-shape" when they are scanning a webpage, which is a visual Procedure. Developers, who are not typical end users, tend to scan all over the page at high speed, in a movement more like this: ^ref-11461

I recommend keeping your goals and targets in mind, as well as the issues and problems you need to address, and regularly check in to see if you are meeting them and if what you are doing (this month, this week, today, this hour etc.) will do the most to move you ahead. ^ref-53878

## Highlight

It is important to ensure that you do not leave someone in a negative state. Reminding them of situations associated with their positive Criteria will help shift them into a more positive frame of mind. If they seem to still be distressed, you may also have them change seats to help them get out of the negative state. ^ref-31557
- Location: [2282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PVSR2J4&location=2282)

### Note
The idea of having someone change seats when they feel distressed is interesting. This psychological "trick" might be helpful in many situations and promote trust.

An Incompetency Attack has nothing to do with one's real level of competence, which may be excellent. It is a strong, emotionally-based belief of one's incompetence, usually felt by someone with a Feeling Pattern in that Context. ^ref-34001

According to Rodger Bailey, most of the population at work has the Choice Pattern (70%). This means that when faced with a difficult or troublesome situation they will first have an emotional response. As a manager you can assist by helping these people disassociate themselves from their feelings, if appropriate, by helping them change perspectives. There are a couple of ways to do this. You can distort time by asking them: "Can you imagine what we'll think about this situation two years from now?" You can have them see it from someone else's viewpoint: "I don't think our customers will care much about this." Or you can have them view the whole thing from the outside: "If you were a fly on the wall when this happened, what would you notice?" With Feeling people, you will probably have to practice your conflict resolution and mediation skills. To maintain their motivation, give them tasks that they can get passionate about. As they are working, watch for signs of distress and overload of tension. These people are the most likely to suffer from stress-related illnesses because they feel stressed more often than people with the other Patterns. Feeling people may overreact, particularly in tense or conflictual circumstances. It would be useful for them to learn how to dissociate or cool off. ^ref-38881

### Note
This is important to recognize because this is how I tend to feel, especially at work, when these situations arise.

## Highlight

When faced with a highly intense reaction from an employee, create rapport by raising your tone to almost the same level as his while saying something positive or surprising: "I'm so upset about you being upset, that I am ready to tear my hair out!" Saying something like that will get their attention, so that you can then channel their energy toward a more productive path. ^ref-55178

### Note
I'm not sure raising your voice is necessary here, but empathizing and connecting/understanding is important.

## Highlight

Inertia can be a powerful force and people get used to having problems or being unhappy, appearing to have little appetite or energy for heavy lifting to get out of a negative situation. ^ref-48263
