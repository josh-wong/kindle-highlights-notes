> **Repository deprecation:** To sync my highlights and notes from Kindle, I had been using the Kindle Highlights plugin for Obsidian. However, the developer of the plugin has not responded to Obsidian's request to remove data collection from the plugin. As a result, I have decided to disable the plugin and deprecate these notes as of March 25, 2023.
